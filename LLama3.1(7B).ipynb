         "CHIEF COMPLAINT Joint pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain. The patient reports that over the weekend, he was moving boxes up and down the basement stairs. By the end of the day, his knees were very painful. The pain is equal in the bilateral knees. He states that he has had some knee problems in the past, but he believes that it was due to the repetition and the weight of the boxes. He states that the pain does not prevent him from doing his activities of daily living. By the end of the day on Saturday, his knee soreness interrupted his sleep. The patient has taken Tylenol and iced his knees for a short period of time, but nothing really seemed to help. The patient states that he had a kidney transplant a few years ago for some polycystic kidneys. He notes that he saw Dr. Gutierrez a couple of weeks ago, and everything was normal at that time. The patient continues to utilize his immunosuppressant medications. Regarding his hypothyroidism, the patient states that he is doing well. He has continued to utilize Synthroid regularly. In regards to his arthritis, the patient states that occasionally he has pain in his elbow, but nothing out of the ordinary. He denies any other symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and weight loss. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS • Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills, or weight loss. • Musculoskeletal: Denies muscle pain. Endorses joint pain in the bilateral knees. • Neurological: Denies headaches. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION • Cardiovascular: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable. • Musculoskeletal: There is edema and erythema of the right knee with pain to palpation. Range of motion is decreased. Left knee exam is normal. RESULTS X-ray of the right knee is unremarkable. Good bony alignment. No acute fractures. Labs: Within normal limits. White blood cell count is within normal limits. Kidney function is normal. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain. Arthritis. • Medical Reasoning: The patient reports increased joint pain in his bilateral knees over the past weekend. Given that his right knee x-ray was unremarkable, I believe this is an acute exacerbation of his arthritis. • Additional Testing: We will order an autoimmune panel for further evaluation. • Medical Treatment: Initiate Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours as needed. • Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to rest his knees. If his symptoms persist, we can consider further imaging and possibly a referral to physical therapy. Hypothyroidism. • Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well on Synthroid and is asymptomatic at this time. • Additional Testing: We will order a thyroid panel. • Medical Treatment: Continue Synthroid. Status post renal transplant. • Medical Reasoning: He is doing well and has been compliant with his immunosuppressive medications. On recent labs, his white blood cell count was within a normal limits and his kidney function is stable. • Medical Treatment: Continue current regimen. Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."

 none whatsoever .  okay . and how about your ... your acid reflux ? how are you doing with ... i know you were making some diet changes .  yeah , i've been pretty good with the diet , but with the pain i have been having, it has been easier to call and have something delivered. so i have been ordering a lot of take-out and fast food that can be delivered to my door so i don't have to go out and up and down the steps to get it myself. but other than that , it's been pretty good .  okay . are you staying hydrated ?  yes .  okay . all right . okay , well , let's go ahead and , uh , i know the nurse did a review of systems , you know , with you , and i know that you're endorsing some back pain and a little bit of dizziness , um , and some blood in your urine . any other symptoms ?

 sure .  hey , dragon ? show me the creatinine . so we ... we drew a creatinine when you came in here because i was concerned about the kidney stones . it ... it is uh ... it is up slightly , which might suggest that you have a little bit of a obstruction there of one-  mm-hmm .  . of the stones . okay ? hey , dragon . show me the abdominal x-rays . okay , and there might be a question of a ... uh , of a stone there lower down , uh , but we'll wait for the official read there . so the , uh , abdominal x-rays show a possible kidney stone , okay ?  okay .  so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you . so , for your first problem , your back pain , i think you're having a recurrence of your kidney stones . so i wan na go ahead and order a ct scan without contrast of your abdomen and pelvis . okay ?

         "CHIEF COMPLAINT Back pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Mr. John Perry is a 61-year-old male with a past medical history significant for kidney stones, migraines, and gastroesophageal reflux, who presents with some back pain. The patient reports that he is feeling a lot of the same pain that he had when he had kidney stones about 2 years ago, so he is a little concerned. The pain started from the right side and moved over and he feels it on the left side of his back. This has been going on for the last 4 days. Initially, the pain was intermittent, but over the last 48 hours it has been constant. He has taken Tylenol, but it does not seem to help. He thinks he has hematuria, but it is hard to detect but it does look a little off color. He endorses nausea and vomiting if he exerts himself or climbs the stairs to his apartment or runs to catch the bus. He also endorses dizziness and lightheadedness with pain in his abdomen. Regarding his migraines, he has been diligent about taking the Imitrex. He denies issues with the migraines. Regarding his gastroesophageal reflux, he reports that he has been doing well with his diet, but notes lately with his pain, he has been eating more fast food and takeout since these options come with delivery. He is staying hydrated. He is taking Protonix 40 mg daily as directed. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS • Gastrointestinal: Endorses abdominal pain. Endorses nausea and vomiting with exertion. • Genitourinary: Endorses urine discoloration. • Musculoskeletal: Endorses back pain. Endorses body aches. • Neurological: Denies headaches. Endorses dizziness and lightheadedness. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION • Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. • Cardiovascular: No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds. • Gastrointestinal: Tender to palpation to the right lower quadrant. CVA tenderness on the right. VITALS REVIEWED • Blood Pressure: Elevated. RESULTS Creatinine level slightly elevated. Abdominal x-ray demonstrates possible kidney stone. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN Mr. John Perry is a 61-year-old male with a past medical history significant for kidney stones, migraines, and gastroesophageal reflux, who presents with back pain. Kidney stones. • Medical Reasoning: He is experiencing pain in his back that is similar to his previous kidney stone pain. His recent abdominal x-ray demonstrates what appears to be a recurrent kidney stone. • Additional Testing: I have ordered a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast. • Medical Treatment: We will start him on Ultram 50 mg as needed every 6 hours for pain. • Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to stay well hydrated and to strain his urine. Migraines. • Medical Reasoning: He has been compliant with Imitrex and is doing well at this time. • Medical Treatment: Continue Imitrex. Reflux. • Medical Reasoning: This is typically well-controlled with dietary modifications. • Medical Treatment: Continue with Protonix 40 mg daily. A refill was provided. Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT Joint pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain. The patient reports that over the weekend, he was moving boxes up and down the basement stairs. By the end of the day, his knees were very painful. The pain is equal in the bilateral knees. He states that he has had some knee problems in the past, but he believes that it was due to the repetition and the weight of the boxes. He states that the pain does not prevent him from doing his activities of daily living. By the end of the day on Saturday, his knee soreness interrupted his sleep. The patient has taken Tylenol and iced his knees for a short period of time, but nothing really seemed to help. The patient states that he had a kidney transplant a few years ago for some polycystic kidneys. He notes that he saw Dr. Gutierrez a couple of weeks ago, and everything was normal at that time. The patient continues to utilize his immunosuppressant medications. Regarding his hypothyroidism, the patient states that he is doing well. He has continued to utilize Synthroid regularly. In regards to his arthritis, the patient states that occasionally he has pain in his elbow, but nothing out of the ordinary. He denies any other symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and weight loss. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS • Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills, or weight loss. • Musculoskeletal: Denies muscle pain. Endorses joint pain in the bilateral knees. • Neurological: Denies headaches. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION • Cardiovascular: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable. • Musculoskeletal: There is edema and erythema of the right knee with pain to palpation. Range of motion is decreased. Left knee exam is normal. RESULTS X-ray of the right knee is unremarkable. Good bony alignment. No acute fractures. Labs: Within normal limits. White blood cell count is within normal limits. Kidney function is normal. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain. Arthritis. • Medical Reasoning: The patient reports increased joint pain in his bilateral knees over the past weekend. Given that his right knee x-ray was unremarkable, I believe this is an acute exacerbation of his arthritis. • Additional Testing: We will order an autoimmune panel for further evaluation. • Medical Treatment: Initiate Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours as needed. • Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to rest his knees. If his symptoms persist, we can consider further imaging and possibly a referral to physical therapy. Hypothyroidism. • Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well on Synthroid and is asymptomatic at this time. • Additional Testing: We will order a thyroid panel. • Medical Treatment: Continue Synthroid. Status post renal transplant. • Medical Reasoning: He is doing well and has been compliant with his immunosuppressive medications. On recent labs, his white blood cell count was within a normal limits and his kidney function is stable. • Medical Treatment: Continue current regimen. Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n",
