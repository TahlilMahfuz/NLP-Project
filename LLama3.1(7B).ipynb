         "CHIEF COMPLAINT Joint pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain. The patient reports that over the weekend, he was moving boxes up and down the basement stairs. By the end of the day, his knees were very painful. The pain is equal in the bilateral knees. He states that he has had some knee problems in the past, but he believes that it was due to the repetition and the weight of the boxes. He states that the pain does not prevent him from doing his activities of daily living. By the end of the day on Saturday, his knee soreness interrupted his sleep. The patient has taken Tylenol and iced his knees for a short period of time, but nothing really seemed to help. The patient states that he had a kidney transplant a few years ago for some polycystic kidneys. He notes that he saw Dr. Gutierrez a couple of weeks ago, and everything was normal at that time. The patient continues to utilize his immunosuppressant medications. Regarding his hypothyroidism, the patient states that he is doing well. He has continued to utilize Synthroid regularly. In regards to his arthritis, the patient states that occasionally he has pain in his elbow, but nothing out of the ordinary. He denies any other symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and weight loss. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS â€¢ Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills, or weight loss. â€¢ Musculoskeletal: Denies muscle pain. Endorses joint pain in the bilateral knees. â€¢ Neurological: Denies headaches. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION â€¢ Cardiovascular: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable. â€¢ Musculoskeletal: There is edema and erythema of the right knee with pain to palpation. Range of motion is decreased. Left knee exam is normal. RESULTS X-ray of the right knee is unremarkable. Good bony alignment. No acute fractures. Labs: Within normal limits. White blood cell count is within normal limits. Kidney function is normal. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain. Arthritis. â€¢ Medical Reasoning: The patient reports increased joint pain in his bilateral knees over the past weekend. Given that his right knee x-ray was unremarkable, I believe this is an acute exacerbation of his arthritis. â€¢ Additional Testing: We will order an autoimmune panel for further evaluation. â€¢ Medical Treatment: Initiate Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours as needed. â€¢ Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to rest his knees. If his symptoms persist, we can consider further imaging and possibly a referral to physical therapy. Hypothyroidism. â€¢ Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well on Synthroid and is asymptomatic at this time. â€¢ Additional Testing: We will order a thyroid panel. â€¢ Medical Treatment: Continue Synthroid. Status post renal transplant. â€¢ Medical Reasoning: He is doing well and has been compliant with his immunosuppressive medications. On recent labs, his white blood cell count was within a normal limits and his kidney function is stable. â€¢ Medical Treatment: Continue current regimen. Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."

 the last four days .  okay . and is ... is the pain coming and going ?  um , at first it was coming and going , and then for about the last 48 hours , it's been a constant , and it's ... it's been pretty bad .  okay . and what have you taken for the pain ?  tylenol , but it really does n't seem to help .  yeah . okay . and do you have any blood in your urine ?  um , uh , it ... i think i do . it's kind of hard to detect , but it does look a little off-color .  okay . all right . um , and have you had , uh , any other symptoms like nausea and vomiting ?  um , if i'm doing something i'm ... i'm , uh , like exerting myself , like climbing the three flights of stairs to my apartment or running to catch the bus , i feel a little dizzy and a little light headed , and i ... i still feel a little bit more pain in my abdomen .  okay . all right . um , so let- let's talk a little bit about your ... your migraines . how are you doing with those ? i know we started you on the imitrex a couple months ago .  i've been pretty diligent about taking the meds . i ... i wan na make sure i stay on top of that , so i've been pretty good with that .  okay , so no issues with the migraine ?  none whatsoever .  okay . and how about your ... your acid reflux ? how are you doing with ... i know you were making some diet changes .  yeah , i've been pretty good with the diet , but with the pain i have been having, it has been easier to call and have something delivered. so i have been ordering a lot of take-out and fast food that can be delivered to my door so i don't have to go out and up and down the steps to get it myself. but other than that , it's been pretty good .  okay . are you staying hydrated ?  yes .  okay . all right . okay , well , let's go ahead and , uh , i know the nurse did a review of systems , you know , with you , and i know that you're endorsing some back pain and a little bit of dizziness , um , and some blood in your urine . any other symptoms ? you know , muscle aches , chest pain ... uh , body aches , anything like that ?  i have some body aches because i think i'm ... i'm favoring , um , my back when i'm walking because of the pain , like i kinda feel it in my muscles , but not out of the ordinary and not surprised 'cause i remember that from two years ago .  okay . all right . well , let's go ahead and ... and look at your vital signs today . hey , dragon ? show me the blood pressure . yeah , so your blood pressure's a little high today . that's probably because you're in some pain , um , but let ... let me just take a listen to your heart and lungs , and i'll let you know what i find , okay ?  sure .  okay , so on ... on physical exam , you do have some , uh , cda tenderness on the right-hand side , meaning that you're tender when i ... when i pound on that .  mm-hmm .  um , and your abdomen also feels a little tender . you have some tenderness of the palpation of the right lower quadrant , but other than that , your heart sounds nice and clear and your lungs are clear as well . so let's go ahead and take a look at some of your results , okay ?  sure .  hey , dragon ? show me the creatinine . so we ... we drew a creatinine when you came in here because i was concerned about the kidney stones . it ... it is uh ... it is up slightly , which might suggest that you have a little bit of a obstruction there of one-  mm-hmm .  . of the stones . okay ? hey , dragon . show me the abdominal x-rays . okay , and there might be a question of a ... uh , of a stone there lower down , uh , but we'll wait for the official read there . so the , uh , abdominal x-rays show a possible kidney stone , okay ?  okay .  so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you . so , for your first problem , your back pain , i think you're having a recurrence of your kidney stones . so i wan na go ahead and order a ct scan without contrast of your abdomen and pelvis . okay ?

         "CHIEF COMPLAINT Back pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Mr. John Perry is a 61-year-old male with a past medical history significant for kidney stones, migraines, and gastroesophageal reflux, who presents with some back pain. The patient reports that he is feeling a lot of the same pain that he had when he had kidney stones about 2 years ago, so he is a little concerned. The pain started from the right side and moved over and he feels it on the left side of his back. This has been going on for the last 4 days. Initially, the pain was intermittent, but over the last 48 hours it has been constant. He has taken Tylenol, but it does not seem to help. He thinks he has hematuria, but it is hard to detect but it does look a little off color. He endorses nausea and vomiting if he exerts himself or climbs the stairs to his apartment or runs to catch the bus. He also endorses dizziness and lightheadedness with pain in his abdomen. Regarding his migraines, he has been diligent about taking the Imitrex. He denies issues with the migraines. Regarding his gastroesophageal reflux, he reports that he has been doing well with his diet, but notes lately with his pain, he has been eating more fast food and takeout since these options come with delivery. He is staying hydrated. He is taking Protonix 40 mg daily as directed. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS â€¢ Gastrointestinal: Endorses abdominal pain. Endorses nausea and vomiting with exertion. â€¢ Genitourinary: Endorses urine discoloration. â€¢ Musculoskeletal: Endorses back pain. Endorses body aches. â€¢ Neurological: Denies headaches. Endorses dizziness and lightheadedness. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION â€¢ Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. â€¢ Cardiovascular: No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds. â€¢ Gastrointestinal: Tender to palpation to the right lower quadrant. CVA tenderness on the right. VITALS REVIEWED â€¢ Blood Pressure: Elevated. RESULTS Creatinine level slightly elevated. Abdominal x-ray demonstrates possible kidney stone. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN Mr. John Perry is a 61-year-old male with a past medical history significant for kidney stones, migraines, and gastroesophageal reflux, who presents with back pain. Kidney stones. â€¢ Medical Reasoning: He is experiencing pain in his back that is similar to his previous kidney stone pain. His recent abdominal x-ray demonstrates what appears to be a recurrent kidney stone. â€¢ Additional Testing: I have ordered a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast. â€¢ Medical Treatment: We will start him on Ultram 50 mg as needed every 6 hours for pain. â€¢ Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to stay well hydrated and to strain his urine. Migraines. â€¢ Medical Reasoning: He has been compliant with Imitrex and is doing well at this time. â€¢ Medical Treatment: Continue Imitrex. Reflux. â€¢ Medical Reasoning: This is typically well-controlled with dietary modifications. â€¢ Medical Treatment: Continue with Protonix 40 mg daily. A refill was provided. Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."

hey , dragon , show me the echocardiogram . so , this is the result of the echocardiogram that we did last year . it showed that you have that low-ish pumping function of your heart at about 45 % . and it also sh- shows some mitral regurgitation , that's that heart murmur that i heard , okay ?  um , hey , dragon , show me the lipid panel . so , looking at your lipid panel from last year , you know , everything , your cholesterol was like , a tiny bit high . but it was n't too , too bad , so i know you're trying to watch your diet . so , we'll repeat another one this year , okay ?  okay .  um , so i wan na just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you , okay ? so , for your first problem your congestive heart failure , um , i wan na continue you on your current medications . but i do wan na increase your lisinopril to 40 milligrams a day , just because your blood pressure's high . and you know , you are retaining a little bit of fluid . i also wan na start you on some lasix , you know , 20 milligrams a day . and have you continue to watch your , your diet , okay ?  okay .  i also wan na repeat another echocardiogram , okay ?  all right .  hey , dragon , order an echocardiogram . from a depression standpoint , it sounds like you're doing really well with that . so , i'm , i'm really happy for you . i'm , i'm glad to see that you're in therapy and you're doing really well . i do n't feel the need to start you on any medications this year , unless you feel differently .  no , i feel the same way .  okay , all right . and then for your last problem your hypertension , you know , again i , i , i think it's out of control . but we'll see , i think , you know , i'd like to see you take the lisinopril as directed , okay ? uh , i want you to record your blood pressures within the patient , you know , take your blood pressure every day . record them to me for like , about a week , so i have to see if we have to add another agent , okay ? 'cause we need to get that under better control for your heart failure to be more successful , okay ?  okay .  do you have any questions ? , and i forgot . for your annual exam , you're due for a mammogram , so we have to schedule for that , as well , okay ?  okay .  okay . do you have any questions ?  can i take all my pills at the same time ?  yeah .  'cause i've been trying to take them at different times of the day , 'cause i did n't know if it was bad to take them all at once or i should separate them . i do n't know .  yeah . you can certainly take them , you know , all at the same time , as long , as yeah , they're all one scale . you can take them all at the same time . just set an alarm-  okay .  . some time during the day to take them , okay ?  that might help me remember better .  all right . that sounds good . all right , well , it's good to see you .  good seeing you too .  hey , dragon , finalize the note .\n",

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT Joint pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain. The patient reports that over the weekend, he was moving boxes up and down the basement stairs. By the end of the day, his knees were very painful. The pain is equal in the bilateral knees. He states that he has had some knee problems in the past, but he believes that it was due to the repetition and the weight of the boxes. He states that the pain does not prevent him from doing his activities of daily living. By the end of the day on Saturday, his knee soreness interrupted his sleep. The patient has taken Tylenol and iced his knees for a short period of time, but nothing really seemed to help. The patient states that he had a kidney transplant a few years ago for some polycystic kidneys. He notes that he saw Dr. Gutierrez a couple of weeks ago, and everything was normal at that time. The patient continues to utilize his immunosuppressant medications. Regarding his hypothyroidism, the patient states that he is doing well. He has continued to utilize Synthroid regularly. In regards to his arthritis, the patient states that occasionally he has pain in his elbow, but nothing out of the ordinary. He denies any other symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and weight loss. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS â€¢ Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills, or weight loss. â€¢ Musculoskeletal: Denies muscle pain. Endorses joint pain in the bilateral knees. â€¢ Neurological: Denies headaches.

Left knee exam is normal. RESULTS X-ray of the right knee is unremarkable. Good bony alignment. No acute fractures. Labs: Within normal limits. White blood cell count is within normal limits. Kidney function is normal. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain. Arthritis. â€¢ Medical Reasoning: The patient reports increased joint pain in his bilateral knees over the past weekend. Given that his right knee x-ray was unremarkable, I believe this is an acute exacerbation of his arthritis. â€¢ Additional Testing: We will order an autoimmune panel for further evaluation. â€¢ Medical Treatment: Initiate Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours as needed. â€¢ Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to rest his knees. If his symptoms persist, we can consider further imaging and possibly a referral to physical therapy. Hypothyroidism. â€¢ Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well on Synthroid and is asymptomatic at this time. â€¢ Additional Testing: We will order a thyroid panel. â€¢ Medical Treatment: Continue Synthroid. Status post renal transplant. â€¢ Medical Reasoning: He is doing well and has been compliant with his immunosuppressive medications. On recent labs, his white blood cell count was within a normal limits and his kidney function is stable. â€¢ Medical Treatment: Continue current regimen. Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n",
