He presents today with complaints of joint pain.\n\nThe patient reports that over the weekend, he was moving boxes up and down the basement stairs. By the end of the day, his knees were very painful. The pain is equal in the bilateral knees. He states that he has had some knee problems in the past, but he believes that it was due to the repetition and the weight of the boxes. He states that the pain does not prevent him from doing his activities of daily living. By the end of the day on Saturday, his knee soreness interrupted his sleep. The patient has taken Tylenol and iced his knees for a short period of time, but nothing really seemed to help.\n\nThe patient states that he had a kidney transplant a few years ago for some polycystic kidneys. He notes that he saw Dr. Gutierrez a couple of weeks ago, and everything was normal at that time. The patient continues to utilize his immunosuppressant medications.\n\nRegarding his hypothyroidism, the patient states that he is doing well. He has continued to utilize Synthroid regularly.\n\nIn regards to his arthritis, the patient states that occasionally he has pain in his elbow, but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nHe denies any other symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and weight loss.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n• Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills, or weight loss.\n• Musculoskeletal: Denies muscle pain. Endorses joint pain in the bilateral knees.\n• Neurological: Denies headaches.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n• Cardiovascular: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable.\n• Musculoskeletal: There is edema and erythema of the right knee with pain to palpation. Range of motion is decreased. Left knee exam is normal.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray of the right knee is unremarkable. Good bony alignment. No acute fractures.\n\nLabs: Within normal limits. White blood cell count is within normal limits. Kidney function is normal.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nAndrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain.\n\nArthritis.\n• Medical Reasoning: The patient reports increased joint pain in his bilateral knees over the past weekend. Given that his right knee x-ray was unremarkable, I believe this is an acute exacerbation of his arthritis.\n• Additional Testing: We will order an autoimmune panel for further evaluation.\n• Medical Treatment: Initiate Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours as needed.\n• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to rest his knees. If his symptoms persist, we can consider further imaging and possibly a referral to physical therapy.\n\nHypothyroidism.\n• Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well on Synthroid and is asymptomatic at this time.\n• Additional Testing: We will order a thyroid panel.\n• Medical Treatment: Continue Synthroid.\n\nStatus post renal transplant.\n• Medical Reasoning: He is doing well and has been compliant with his immunosuppressive medications.

The pain started from the right side and moved over and he feels it on the left side of his back. This has been going on for the last 4 days. Initially, the pain was intermittent, but over the last 48 hours it has been constant. He has taken Tylenol, but it does not seem to help. He thinks he has hematuria, but it is hard to detect but it does look a little off color. He endorses nausea and vomiting if he exerts himself or climbs the stairs to his apartment or runs to catch the bus. He also endorses dizziness and lightheadedness with pain in his abdomen.\n\nRegarding his migraines, he has been diligent about taking the Imitrex. He denies issues with the migraines.\n\nRegarding his gastroesophageal reflux, he reports that he has been doing well with his diet, but notes lately with his pain, he has been eating more fast food and takeout since these options come with delivery. He is staying hydrated. He is taking Protonix 40 mg daily as directed.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n• Gastrointestinal: Endorses abdominal pain.

                  "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow-up of chronic problems.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAnna Mitchell is a 44-year-old female with a past medical history significant for arthritis, gout, and reflux, who presents today for follow-up of her chronic problems. It has been about 6 months since I last saw the patient.\n\nThe patient reports her arthritis is starting to get better. She has been trying to move her body with pilates and lifting weights. This has helped build up some muscles and her joint pain has reduced. The patient has also continued to attend physical therapy, which she feels has been beneficial.\n\nMs. Mitchell had an episode of gout of her right first big toe about 2 months ago. She states she is doing well on the allopurinol 100 mg once daily and has had no further flare ups.\n\nRegarding her acid reflux, she was placed on omeprazole 40 mg once a day to help with some of the symptoms she was having. She started to make some dietary modifications, but she still needs to make more progress. She reports episodes of vomiting in the morning. The patient also has abdominal pain and bloating. Her last bowel movement was 2 days ago, and it was normal. She denies blood in her stool.\n\nThe patient denies unexplained weight gain or loss, fevers, chills.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n• Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills, or weight loss.\n• Gastrointestinal: Denies hematochezia, melena. Endorses vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloating.\n• Musculoskeletal: Endorses joint pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.\n• Cardiovascular: No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds.\n• Gastrointestinal: Pain to palpation of the right upper quadrant. No rebound or guarding. No peritoneal signs.\n• Musculoskeletal: Right knee shows a little effusion. Slight pain to palpation. Some decreased range of motion.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAutoimmune panel is within normal limits.\n\nX-ray of the right knee demonstrates residual arthritis. No fractures noted.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nAnna Mitchell is a 44-year-old female with a past medical history significant for arthritis, gout, and reflux, who presents today for follow-up of her chronic problems.\n\nAcid reflux with nausea and vomiting.\n• Medical Reasoning: She reports episodes of vomiting in the morning, as well as abdominal pain and bloating. She has been compliant with omeprazole and has made a few dietary modifications.\n• Additional Testing: We will order an ultrasound of her right upper quadrant, as well as additional labs, to rule out biliary etiology.\n• Medical Treatment: Continue omeprazole 40 mg once daily.\n• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with dietary modifications.\n\nGout.\n• Medical Reasoning: Her flares are well controlled on allopurinol.\n• Medical Treatment: Continue allopurinol 100 mg once daily. This was refilled today.\n\nArthritis.\n• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well and has remained active since her last visit. Physical therapy has also been beneficial for her. Her right knee x-ray demonstrated residual arthritis but was otherwise normal.\n• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised her to continue pilates and using the knee. She will contact me if she has any issues and we can consider further imaging or intervention at that time.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."

The patient was doing yard work over the weekend when he began to feel short of breath and a full chest pain for approximately hour. He denies a history of chest pain. The patient notes that after he finished he felt fine. He has not had any other symptoms since that time. He denies a family history of heart disease.\n\nThe patient underwent right knee surgery a couple of months ago and has been feeling well since then. He has been in rehab and recovery. He denies chest pain while doing exercises in physical therapy for his knee.\n\nHis blood pressure was noted to be 180/95 mmHg when he visited the emergency room. He notes that his blood pressure has not been as high as usual.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\nNeck\n• General Examination: I do feel a little large thyroid that is not tender.

His blood pressure today was still elevated.\n\nChest pain and hypertension.\n• Medical Reasoning: Given his recent episode of blood pressure elevation and chest pain, I suspect an element of coronary artery disease as well as pumping dysfunction.\n• Medical Treatment: We will change his blood pressure regimen to carvedilol 25 mg twice a day. He should also continue lisinopril 10 mg a day and I want to see how his blood pressure does on that regimen. I also recommended cardiac catheterization on him to make sure that he does not have any blockages in his heart.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n"

                  "[doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 .\n[doctor] hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ?\n[patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?\n[doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great .\n[patient] yes , i did .\n[doctor] anything new since your last visit ?\n[patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .\n[doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ?\n[patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .\n[doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 .\n[patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?\n[doctor] yep , right here .\n[patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .\n[doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself .\n[patient] that would be great .\n[doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .\n[patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .\n[doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well .\n[patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?\n[doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study .\n[patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .\n[doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?\n[patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] so , i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freer since , um , i'll be on vacation after july 8th .\n[doctor] okay , good .\n[patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?\n[doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ?\n[patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .\n[doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ...\n[patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .\n[doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much .\n[patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .\n[doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you .\n[patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .\n[doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated .\n[patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .\n[doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .\n[patient] okay , thank you . got it .\n[doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ?\n[patient] no , not that i know of .\n[doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] all right .\n[patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .\n[doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ?\n[patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .\n[doctor] okay . we might give you some of that .\n[patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .\n[doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ?\n[patient] yes , i also do have that problem .\n[doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .\n[patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .\n[doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right , sounds good .\n[patient] great .\n[doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .\n[patient] okay , i will do that .\n[doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .\n[patient] okay , that's okay .\n[doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .\n[patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .\n[doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .\n[patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .\n[doctor] okay , great . let's see them .\n[patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .\n[doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 .\n[patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .\n[doctor] yeah , this is much better .\n[patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .\n[doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .\n[patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?\n[doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices .\n[patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .\n[doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan .\n[patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?\n[doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started .\n[patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?\n[doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] does that make sense ?\n[patient] yes , it does .\n[doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study .\n[patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?\n[doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .\n[patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .\n[doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .\n[patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .\n[doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up .\n[patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .\n[doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you .\n[patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .\n[doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .\n[patient] okay , will do .\n[doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know .\n[patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .\n[doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .\n[patient] okay , i can do that .\n[doctor] but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets .\n[patient] okay , sounds good .\n[doctor] um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels . sound good ?\n[patient] yes , that sounds great .\n[doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though .\n[patient] okay , that would be great .\n[doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] if you need some , uh , just let me know .\n[patient] okay , i will . i'll let you know .\n[doctor] okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time .\n[patient] okay , great , thank you so much .\n[doctor] you're welcome .\n[doctor] so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal . two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information . on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions . unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .",
                  "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nHypothyroidism.\nAbnormal liver enzymes.\nAbnormal weight gain.\nAcne vulgaris.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nChristine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.\n\nWhen the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.\n\nMrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.\n\nThe patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.\n\nShe denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHypothyroidism.\nAcne Vulgaris.\nVitamin D deficiency.\nAbnormal weight gain.\nHirsutism.\nConstipation.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nBenzoyl Peroxide.\nClindamycin Gel applied topically.\nVitamin D 2000 IU daily.\nUnithroid.\nMiraLAX.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nNo known allergies.\n\nRESULTS\n\nDexamethasone Suppression Test: Normal.\n\nSalivary Cortisol Tests: 2 out of 3 were normal.

I have printed out the prescription and a discount card, which should result in a reduced price. She will contact my office if she encounters additional issues.\n\nAbnormal liver enzymes\nWe have seen improvement since the discontinuation of Microgestin. I recommended the spermicide Phexxi for alternative birth control. The patient will also continue working on weight loss, which should additionally improve her liver enzymes.\n\nAbnormal weight gain\nCushing’s Syndrome has been ruled out. I reviewed the weight loss study with the patient, she will call within a month if she is interested in participating. I advised her to follow a low carbohydrate, low cholesterol, abstain from alcohol, and reduce fatty foods diet.\n\nAcne vulgaris\nEpiduo was not covered and too expensive.

                  "[doctor] this is philip gutierrez , date of birth 1/12/71 . he is a 50-year-old male here for a second opinion regarding the index finger on the right hand . he had a hyperextension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in march of this year . he was offered an injection of the a1 polyregion , but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to dexamethasone , which causes his heart to race . he was scheduled to see dr. alice davis , which it does n't appear he did . he had an mri of that finger , because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of , quote , \" fds tendon , \" end quote . he has been seen at point may orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a pr , pa at that institution .\n[doctor] at that practice , an mri was obtained on 4/24/2021 , which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index mcp joint , partial-thickness tear of the right fds , and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the fdp and fds tendons . radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index mcp joint were intact , as the mcp joint capsule . extensor tendons also deemed intact .\n[doctor] his x-rays , four views of the right hand today , show no bony abnormalities , joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand , no soft tissue shadows of concern , no arthritis . hi , how are you , mr . gutierrez ?\n[patient] i'm good , how about you ?\n[doctor] well , how can i help you today ?\n[patient] so i was a passenger in , uh , a car that was rear-ended , and we were hit multiple times . i felt two bumps , which slung me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger .\n[doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ?\n[patient] um , i do n't really know . i just felt , like , it felt like i laid on my finger , and so , i felt like it went back , and it's been hurting since about march . and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened . so i , and i ca n't make a fist , but sometimes the pain's unbearable . and , like , even driving hurts .\n[doctor] okay , so this was march of this year , so maybe about three months ago ?\n[patient] yeah , and it's still swollen . so i was seeing , uh , an orthopedist , and they sent me to an occupational therapist . and i've been doing therapy with them , and then they sent me to go back and get an mri . so i went and got the mri . uh , then they told me that the mri came back , and it said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection , because the injection was going to make the tear worse .\n[doctor] mm-hmm .\n[patient] and then , after he got the mri , he said that i have , uh , a tear in my finger , and that he did n't wan na do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there , and then the oper- , occupational therapy says it's because of the tear . and then , they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing , and doing things with my hand . so i feel like i'm not getting medical care , really .\n[doctor] yeah , i see that .\n[patient] so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand , because i am right-handed , and i kinda need that hand .\n[doctor] what do you do for a living ?\n[patient] uh , i'm an x-ray tech .\n[doctor] well , um , so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] uh , do you take any chronic medications of su- , significance ?\n[patient] uh , i do take a blood pressure pill , and that's it .\n[doctor] okay , and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methylprednisolone ?\n[patient] uh , that's correct .\n[doctor] all right , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . all right , so , lean over here . all right , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse , no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger , normal creases , slightly diminished over the pip of the index finger compared to the middle finger .\n[doctor] his index finger rests in a 10-degree pip-flexed , uh , position . all right , is that uncomfortable to correct that , and is it uncomfortable now here ?\n[patient] yeah , uh , when you push on it , yeah .\n[doctor] all right , how about here ?\n[patient] um , there , it's not .\n[doctor] okay , not as bad ?\n[patient] yeah , it feels , uh , a little numb .\n[doctor] gotcha , all right . bend , bend the tip of this finger . bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . keep bending . all right , straighten it out . all right , and now , bend it for me as best you can .\n[patient] my goodness . it feels like it's , it's tearing in there .\n[doctor] okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger , and bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . all right , straighten that out , and now , bend it for me as best you can . all right , good . now , bend that finger , and i'm going to pull , put it down like this . and then bend that finger for me . okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? all right . now , make a fist . great , so relax the finger . all right , so just keep it , keep , when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand . is that okay there ?\n[patient] ow , .\n[doctor] okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that .\n[patient] well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint .\n[doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you .\n[patient] okay . i thought it would straighten it out .\n[doctor] no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine .\n[patient] so the good one is good ?\n[doctor] yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] yeah , so you know , i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon blocking excursion of these other tendons , that they ca n't get through to the pulley .\n[patient] okay , all right .\n[doctor] so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection , and i would avoid the dexamethasone , because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone , which is a celestone .\n[patient] i've gotten another , uh , methylprednisolone , and that itched me like crazy .\n[doctor] did it ? yeah , this one is water-soluble , and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit , and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger .\n[patient] all right , we'll give it a try .\n[doctor] good . so , you do the shot , and it's going to take about three to five days before it starts feeling better . and then probably over the next couple of weeks , it'll start feeling even better .\n[patient] perfect .\n[doctor] all right , so take advantage of that . you've got ta start moving the finger . you're not going to tear anything or break a bone , uh , because your intensors , extensors are intact . but your collateral ligaments are intact , so you've got a stiff , sore finger . i'm going to try to help as much as i can with this soreness part , and then you have to do all the stiff part .\n[patient] the lady in occupational therapy tried some maneuvers to straighten the finger out , but it even hurt after i left . the whole thing just swelled up .\n[doctor] hmm . okay , so it was injured , and you had scar tissue . and then , you had post-traumatic inflammation . and so , this will help some with all of that . it's not going to make it to where your finger is like , , my finger does n't hurt at all , but it will make it to where at least tolerable , to where you can make some gains . and we actually might need to repeat this as well .\n[patient] will i be able to drive ? i drove myself here today , so ...\n[doctor] yeah , it may feel a little weird , but it's totally safe for you to drive .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] so for mr . gutierrez , just put that he has a post-traumatic rather severe stenosing tenosynovitis of his right index finger , and the plan is steroid injection today , do a trigger injection , but i'm using a cc of betamethasone . so , mr . gutierrez , do you have , um , therapy scheduled or set up ?\n[patient] uh , not at the moment .\n[doctor] all right , well , i mean , you know that you need to move that finger , and i think to the degree that they can help you do that . so i want you to move that finger , finger , but i think it would be , uh , beneficial for you to have an accountability , um , so at least you know to check in with them once a week with somebody .\n[patient] um , okay . that's kinda why i'm here , for you to tell me what needs to be done , you know ?\n[doctor] yeah , so i'll write you out , um , an outpatient prescription . i think if you go back to the same people where you were before , i'm hoping that after this injection , you're going to be able to do a whole lot more with them . so let's do outpatient once a week for six weeks , um , and then full active and passive range of motion is the goal with no restrictions .\n[patient] all right , sounds like a plan .\n[doctor] all right , well , i will have the nurse set up the injection procedure , and we'll , and i'll be back shortly .\n[patient] thanks , doc .\n[doctor] right trigger finger injection template . attempted to inject one cc of celestone with f- , a half a cc of lidocaine . however , the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle , with contortions of the hand , and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick . needle was withdrawn . the patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath . we attempted a second time for a similar injection using the same technique with one cc of celestone and half a cc of lidocaine . a small parma- , uh , palmar vein bled a scant amount , which was cleaned up and band-aid applied . reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger . recommended icing in it this evening , and taking ibuprofen .",
                  "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight index finger hyperextension injury.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMs. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion regarding evaluation of the right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in 03/2021.\n\nIn summary, the patient was the passenger in a vehicle that was rear-ended. He reports they were hit multiple times as he felt 2 bumps which caused his to sling forward hyperextending his right index finger. He was offered an injection of the A1 pulley region, but he did not want any steroid due to a reaction to dexamethasone that causes his heart to race. The patient was scheduled to see Dr. Alice Davis, but he has not seen his yet. The patient has been seen at Point May Orthopedics, by the physical therapy staff and a physician assistant at that practice. He underwent an MRI of the right index finger because they were concerned about a capsular strain plus or minus a rupture of the \"FDS tendon.\"\n\nThe patient states that he is unable to make a fist secondary to pain and swelling in the right index finger. He describes a pulling, tearing sensation in the right index finger. The pain is exacerbated by driving. He notes that he has been wearing a right index finger splint.\n\nThe patient denies any history of diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. He reports only taking medication for hypertension and denies taking any other chronic medications of significance. He also notes methylprednisolone causes his to itch.\n\nMs. Gutierrez is employed as an x-ray technician.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHypertension.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nEmployed as x-ray technician.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nMethylprednisolone causes itching.\nDexamethasone causes palpitations.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n• Musculoskeletal: Right index finger pain.\n• Endocrine: Denies diabetes.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nVery pleasant, healthy appearing, cooperative male in no distress.\n\nNeurological\nGrossly intact. Slightly diminished sensation to light touch over the right PIP joint of the index finger compared to the middle finger.\n\nCardiovascular\nRegular rate and rhythm.\n\nMusculoskeletal\nExam of the right hand, there is no swelling or ecchymosis in the palm on the volar surface of his index finger. Normal creases are noted. Index finger rests in a 10 degree PIP joint flexed position with discomfort upon correction. Bilateral extremities 2+ radial pulses.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays today, 4 views of the right hand, show no bony abnormalities. Joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand. No soft tissue shadows of concern. No arthritis.\n\nMRI of the right index finger performed on 04/24/2021. Independent review of the images shows focal soft tissue swelling over the right index MCP joint, partial-thickness tear of the right FDS, and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index MCP joint were intact as was the MCP joint capsule. The extensor tendons were also deemed intact.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n• Stenosing tenosynovitis of right index finger.\n\nMs. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion of his right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year. The findings of his examination are consistent with rather severe post-traumatic stenosing tenosynovitis.\n\nPLAN\n\nThe patient and I had a lengthy discussion regarding his history, symptoms, and radiographic findings. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of stenosing tenosynovitis and the anatomy of the flexor tendons and pulley system in the hand. I explained to the patient that the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon was clearly intact and that He is suffering from post-traumatic inflammation around the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon blocking excursion of the flexor tendons to the A1 pulley.\n\nTreatment options were discussed including conservative management with corticosteroid injections and their statistical effectiveness. Surgical correction was also briefly discussed, although I recommend exhausting non-operative measures with a minimum of 2 injections before proceeding with surgery. I recommended a right index trigger finger cortisone injection today, and the patient elected to proceed. I also recommend that the patient report to occupational therapy once a week for the next 6 weeks to work on full active and passive right index finger range of motion with no restrictions.\n\nThe patient verbalizes understanding with the treatment plan and agrees. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction today.\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nRight index trigger finger injection.\nThe patient understands the risks and benefits and elected to proceed, signed consent obtained. An attempt was made to inject 1.0 cc of Celestone with 0.5 cc of lidocaine. However, the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick. Therefore, the needle was withdrawn. The patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath. We attempted a 2nd time for a similar injection using the same technique with 1.0 cc of Celestone and 0.5 cc of lidocaine. There was a small palmar vein that bled a scant amount, which was cleaned up off the back of the patient's hand. A Band-Aid was applied. He was reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger. I recommended icing it this evening and taking ibuprofen.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nOccupational therapy as prescribed.\n"

you look trim .\n[patient] no , i think i'm pretty much the same as i've always been .\n[doctor] really ? okay , maybe it's just your black shirt . makes you look thin .\n[patient] yeah , i guess that's it .\n[doctor] so health wise , how is everything going ?\n[patient] good , the testosterone's going well .\n[doctor] that's great .\n[patient] uh , it helped me out . i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects . not so much physically because like i said i've- i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my bloodwork .\n[doctor] okay , well that's good .\n[patient] so the finasteride i'm only taking half a pill , it's the 5 milligram one .\n[doctor] yeah , i remember you telling me that .\n[patient] and cialis , on the days i work out i take 5 milligrams otherwise i take two and a half milligram pills , but , uh , i have been out of it .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] but overall i'm doing well , i'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together .\n[doctor] good . it's always great to hear . well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] in and out .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there .\n[patient] great . so i wanted to show you something .\n[doctor] sure .\n[patient] look at this .\n[doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol ?\n[patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .\n[doctor] right .\n[patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers .\n[doctor] wow , that's remarkable .\n[patient] is it the test ? it's the only change .\n[doctor] i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it .\n[patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .\n[doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference .\n[patient] 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .\n[doctor] absolutely .\n[patient] my red blood cell count has increased .\n[doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though .\n[patient] stable .\n[doctor] your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think .\n[patient] yeah . , is it ?\n[doctor] yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good .\n[patient] nice , that's good news .\n[doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so .\n[patient] so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?\n[doctor] yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me .\n[patient] okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .\n[doctor] well , your levels are high .\n[patient] are they right now ?\n[doctor] well , i mean they were last time .\n[patient] yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .\n[doctor] i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ?\n[patient] i figure i'm on my eighth day today .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] so i'm due to dose on thursday or friday .\n[doctor] all right .\n[patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .\n[doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well .\n[patient] yeah , i'm feeling good .\n[doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 .\n[patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot .\n[doctor] likely they are taking more than testosterone , but still .\n[patient] and they are taking stuff for a long time .\n[doctor] true . but right now i would not change your dose .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] make sense ?\n[patient] it does , i appreciate the discussion .\n[doctor] no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ?\n[patient] no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] i would prefer the paper prescription .\n[doctor] for all of them ?\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] all right , will do . i'm gon na get your prescriptions .\n[patient] okay , thank you .",
                  "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nHypogonadism.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMr. Paul Edwards is a 59-year-old male, an established patient, who presents to the clinic today for hypogonadism. He was last seen on 11/24/2020. The patient’s history includes positive for HIV, and today he is concerned with gynecomastia.\n\nThe patient is doing well, overall, and feels the testosterone is helping. He reports weight stability, feels lively, good, more vigorous, and he is sleeping well. He also thinks the testosterone is having a positive effect on his blood work. He endorses that his triglycerides have always been elevated and adds that they were as high as 265 mg/dL. The patient presented a copy of his bloodwork, showing a significant decrease in his cholesterol after 5 months. Mr. Edwards questioned if the changes in his blood work were due to the testosterone. He also noted that his red blood cell count has not increased. The patient inquired about possible benefits of Indole-3-carbinol, which is a broccoli extract for estrogen control.\n\nCurrently, the patient is dosing 140 ng/dL of testosterone per week and inquired if his dose could be increased to 175 ng/dL. He recalled that he had recently injected testosterone before his last testosterone blood work was performed; last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL. The patient confirms continued daily use of Finasteride and Cialis, prescribed by me, and stated he needs a refill for both.\n\nMr. Edwards mentioned he is taking correct steps to get his life \"together.\" He also uses a med calendar to help with medication compliance.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHIV\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nUtilizes med calendar to support medication compliance.\nActively trying to get his life together.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nCialis 5 mg tablet by mouth on days he exercises, 2.5 mg tablet by mouth on days without exercise.\nFinasteride 5 mg half tablet daily.\nTestosterone cypionate 140 mg.\n\nRESULTS\n\nPSA 0.6 ng/mL.\nTriglycerides 145 mg/dL.\nTotal testosterone 1500 ng/dL, 11/24/2021.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n• Hypogonadism.\n\nPLAN\n\nI recommend maintaining current management. The patient’s last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL, although this level was likely related to his recent injection. He requested an increase to his testosterone cypionate from 140 mg to 175 mg, which I denied due to his already high testosterone levels. I counseled the patient on the risks associated with high testosterone levels and Indole-3-carbinol and it’s lacking evidence to support his estrogen levels. The last time his estradiol levels were checked, they were normal; recommend annual screening.\n\nI provided paper prescription refills for Cialis and Finasteride.\n"

and are you using the bathroom okay ?\n[patient] uh yes , everything is good .\n[doctor] good . how is your heart burn doing ? any problems with that ?\n[patient] no , it did get bad for a while so i tried to take some prilosec and then stopped that other one .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] um i did that for like , gosh , i think it was two weeks back in january and have n't had any problems since .\n[doctor] great .\n[patient] um and after i stopped taking that um i went back to the stomach one , so i'm doing good now .\n[doctor] okay and you're still due for a colonoscopy , correct ?\n[patient] uh yeah , that's right .\n[doctor] all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great .\n[patient] good , that's a relief to hear .\n[doctor] your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all in all i think you're doing good on paper though .\n[patient] what about , um what's it called , a1c ? does that show up ?\n[doctor] um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march .\n[patient] all righty .\n[doctor] so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today .\n[patient] all righty that sounds good .\n[doctor] i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you uh urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good .\n[patient] okay great . that all sounds awesome .\n[doctor] all right let's take a quick listen .\n[doctor] use my general physical exam template .\n[doctor] and take a couple of deep breaths for me .\n[doctor] your lungs sound pretty good to me so keep doing what you're doing . um uh , like i said , i think you're doing good overall but let's just talk about a few things .\n[patient] all righty .\n[doctor] so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the 2-ish range . yours is a little bit less than 2 and we want that 2-ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle . so i might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement . it's supposed to be twice a day so that's kind of annoying , but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too , so i think you'll do fine .\n[patient] yeah , that'll be okay .\n[doctor] great . now before surgery we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand .\n[patient] yes , okay , i have everything written down on my phone , and i have a letter taped to the side of my bed to remind me .\n[doctor] perfect ! we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of june .\n[patient] okay , i'll put that down .\n[doctor] you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekgs . um we do n't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently , and we do n't need any more blood work because we did that today .\n[patient] yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular . but i'm happy to do one today , no problem .\n[doctor] lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ?\n[patient] yeah , i have both .\n[doctor] okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like .\n[patient] okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out . might we be able to get the procedure done sooner ? maybe in the next 30 days ? is that okay ?\n[doctor] um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good .\n[doctor] i think either direction they're good technicians of the colon .\n[patient] okay , yeah whatever you can get me in , that works great .\n[doctor] so i'll call around . now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go .\n[patient] great , thank you .\n[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day . let us know if you need anything else , okay ?\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] all right , assessment and plan .\n[doctor] chronic chf . mixed presentation . had a exacerbation of cf , chf earlier in the spring . we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about 3 , 3 and a half pounds down in weight . breathing is non-labored . going to repeat ekg today but otherwise continue with her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate .\n[doctor] uh number 2 , pre-op examination . she is , she's having a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed which we'll try to have done at uh bartley regional , rightley regional hospital in the next month , uh , prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer .\n[doctor] uh the next one is diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks .",
                  "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow-up.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nNicole Miller is a 71-year-old female who presents for follow-up. The patient was called in for a follow up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. Her BNP had been 3000 in 03/2021, up to 6000 in 04/2021. She was increasingly dyspneic. We had changed her furosemide to torsemide at 20 mg by mouth daily. The patient is not on a potassium supplement currently. Her lisinopril had also been increased up to 10 mg daily in 03/2021.\n\nI last saw her in 04/2021, and she had reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at East Metropolitan Hospital, so it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status prior to surgery. She is currently scheduled to have surgery on 06/24/2021. She plans to discontinue clopidogrel a week before her surgery.\n\nThe patient states that she has lost approximately 3 to 3.5 pounds since her last visit in 04/2021. Some of which may be water weight decreasing. She did report experiencing bilateral leg cramps which she treated with consumption of pickle juice, which did resolve the cramps. She thought the cramps were related to her being cold.\n\nShe is still taking iron supplementation. She denies any concerns with defecation.\n\nRegarding her prior symptoms of heartburn, she denies any recent gastrointestinal issues. She notes that her heartburn was severe at one point but resolved after trying Prilosec for 2 weeks in 01/2021. She denies any issues with heartburn since that time and has stopped taking Prilosec altogether. She has since transitioned back to her original \"stomach medication\".\n\nThe patient is due for a colonoscopy. She is currently double covered with Medicare and private insurance.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nChronic Congestive Heart Failure.\nIron deficiency Anemia.\n\nMedications\nPrilosec.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nNo family history of colon cancer.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nTorsemide 20 mg by mouth daily.\nLisinopril 10 mg daily.\n\nRESULTS\n\nMagnesium 1.7, hemoglobin WNL, potassium 3.9, creatinine 0.7, BUN 23.\n03/2020 Hgb A1c 5.5.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n• Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.\n• Preop examination.\n• Diabetes mellitus.\n• Colonoscopy\n\nPLAN\n\nChronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.\nShe had an exacerbation of CHF earlier in the spring. We switched her from furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically, she is doing a lot better. She is about 1.5 kg down in weight. Her breathing is nonlabored. We are going to repeat an EKG today. Otherwise, continue her current regimen. Labs were checked and creatinine is appropriate. Her magnesium is below the preferred 2 at 1.7, with some occurrence of bilateral leg cramping, therefore we will start her on magnesium supplement.\n\nPreop examination.\nShe is going to be having a right knee replacement at the end of 06/2021. We will schedule a preop check the first week or two of June prior to the surgery. She will discontinue clopidogrel for one week prior to knee replacement surgery; we will provide a reminder to patient of this as well.\n\nDiabetes mellitus.\nA1c is 5.5 on last check, so there is no need for a further A1c today. She may need another one prior to her surgery next month.\n\nColonoscopy.\nThe patient is overdue for a colonoscopy, which we will try to have done at County Hospital in the next month, prior to a change in her insurance. This is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for. No family history of colon cancer.\n\nThe patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nComplete EKG today. Schedule a preop checkup 1st or 2nd week of June. Start magnesium supplement. Call the clinic with any questions or new symptoms.\n"

                  "[doctor] dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03/04/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ?\n[patient] good morning .\n[doctor] it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller .\n[patient] it's nice to meet you as well .\n[doctor] so , i hear you are having pain this arm . is that correct ?\n[patient] that's correct .\n[doctor] okay . and it seems like it's worse at night ?\n[patient] well , right now the hand is .\n[doctor] mm-hmm .\n[patient] and the thing started about two weeks ago . i woke up about two o'clock in the morning and it was just hurting something awful .\n[doctor] uh- .\n[patient] and then i laid some ice on it and it finally did ease up .\n[doctor] okay , that's good .\n[patient] so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down , thinking it would , like , help the circulation , but it did n't .\n[doctor] okay , i see .\n[patient] and so , after a while , when it eased off , maybe about four , five am , i laid back down and it did n't start up again .\n[doctor] mm-hmm , okay .\n[patient] um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .\n[doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though .\n[patient] um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .\n[doctor] probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ?\n[patient] uh , no .\n[doctor] okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ?\n[patient] um , some days . if it bothers me at night , then the day following , it usually will bother me some .\n[doctor] okay . and do you just notice it in the hand , or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ?\n[patient] well , it starts there and goes all the way down the arm .\n[doctor] okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ?\n[patient] uh , yes .\n[doctor] okay . like , in terms of gripping things ?\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] uh , this finger , i hurt it some time ago as well .\n[doctor] really ?\n[patient] yeah . it does n't work properly . or , it works very rarely .\n[doctor] gotcha . and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids , or ?\n[patient] uh , well , she gave me some numbing medicine . it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin . uh , you should have my full list in your notes , though . since then it has n't really bothered me at night . also , just so you know , i am a va and i'm one percent disabled from this leg , um , issues from my knees down to my feet .\n[doctor] okay . is it neuropathy ?\n[patient] uh , yep .\n[doctor] gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ?\n[patient] no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .\n[doctor] okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ?\n[patient] yeah , just a little strain .\n[doctor] okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ?\n[patient] uh , yes .\n[doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off .\n[patient] i see .\n[doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ?\n[patient] i think that sounds good to me .\n[doctor] okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list .\n[patient] uh , no , i do n't .\n[doctor] okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ?\n[patient] um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] i am taking eliquis , though .\n[doctor] okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ?\n[patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .\n[doctor] okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again .\n[patient] yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .\n[doctor] okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ?\n[patient] well , my hand is still bothering me .\n[doctor] okay . so , you're saying your neck is not bothering you but the hand is . okay . so then , let's just stick with the plan . mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed , that's giving your hand the issue . and then , we're going to set you up with the epidural .\n[patient] okay . sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . so , keep going with the gabapentin . i will order the imaging of your neck , and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand , and then we'll follow up afterwards .\n[patient] all right . is the mri today ?\n[doctor] um , you probably ca n't do it today , but let me talk with roy and see how soon we can get it done . just give me a quick minute , and then roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] all right . well , it was nice meeting you , my friend .\n[patient] you as well . thank you .\n[doctor] physical exam , elderly white gentleman presents in a wheelchair . no apparent distress . per the template , down through neuro- neurologic . one plus bilateral biceps . triceps brachioradialis . reflexes bilateral all negative . follow up and take out the lower extremities . gait not assessed today . strength and sensation is per the template . uh , upper and lower extremities . musculoskeletal , he is non-tender over his cervical spine . he does have mildly restricted cervical exte- extension . right and left lateral rotation which is symmetric , which gives him mild lateral neck pain but no radi- radicular pain . spurling's maneuver is benign .\n[doctor] paragraph , diagnostics . cervical x-ray 6421 . cervical x-ray reveals significant disc degeneration at c56 , and to a lower extent c45 and c34 . significant lower lumbar facet arthropathy c67 and c7-t1 is difficult to visualize in the current x-rays .\n[doctor] paragraph , impression . number one , left upper extremity neuropathy suspicious for cervical radicularopathy . possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy . number two , neck pain in the setting of arthritis disc degeneration .\n[doctor] paragraph , plan . i suspect that this is a flare of cervical radicularopathy . i'm going to set him up for a cervical mri , and we'll tentatively plan for a left c7-t1 epidural afterwards , although the exact location will be pending the mri results . he'll continue his home exercise program as well as twice a day gabapentin . we'll follow up with him afterwards to determine his level of relief . he denies any blood thinners .",
                  "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nLeft arm pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nHe reports that his left arm pain began approximately 2 weeks ago. He woke around 2:00 am with intense pain in his left arm and hand. He applied ice and after 2-3 hours, the pain improved and he was able to go back to sleep, the pain did not return until that evening. After several nights of experiencing the left arm and hand pain, he was seen by Betty Ross, PA-C. She suspected a pinched nerve and completed x-rays of the cervical spine, prescribed gabapentin and prednisone, and referred the patient to us. The patient has benefited from the gabapentin and prednisone, reporting improvement of pain at night.\n\nThe pain initially was encountered at night, but the patient notes that the symptoms carry into the next day. He denies pain when moving his neck, turning his head, and moving his shoulder.\n\nMr. Clark does report a history of a left finger injury, stating “it rarely works”, and neuropathy in one leg from his knee to his foot which he receives 1% disability for. The patient is a veteran.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nPeripheral neuropathy.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient is a veteran and receives 1% disability.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nGabapentin tablet.\nPrednisone tablet.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nElderly Caucasian male in no apparent distress. Presents in wheelchair.\n\nNeurologic\nUpper extremities: 1+ bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, reflexes bilaterally, negative. Negative Hoffman's\nGait: Not assessed today.\n\nStrength\nUpper extremities: Normal throughout the biceps, triceps, deltoid, grip strength, and finger abduction, bilaterally.\nSensation: Intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.\n\nMusculoskeletal\nCervical: Nontender over cervical spine. Mildly restricted cervical extension and right and left lateral rotation, which is symmetric, which gives him mild lateral neck pain, but no radicular pain. Spurling's maneuver is benign.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray Cervical Spine, 06/04/2021.\nImpression: Significant disc degeneration at C5-6 and to a lesser extent C4-5 and C3-4. Significant lower facet arthropathy. C6-7 and C7-T1 are difficult to visualize in the current x-rays.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n• Left upper extremity neuropathy, suspicious for cervical radiculopathy, possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy\n• Neck pain in the setting of arthritis and disc generation\n\nPLAN\n\nI suspect that this is a flare of cervical radiculopathy. I am going to set him up for a cervical MRI. We will tentatively plan for a left C7-T1 epidural afterwards, although the exact level will be pending the MRI results. He will continue his home exercise program as well as twice daily gabapentin. We will follow up with him afterwards to determine his level of relief. He denies any blood thinners.\n\nThis plan was discussed in detail with the patient who is in agreement.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nContinue home exercise program and twice daily gabapentin. Schedule MRI and epidural injection. Follow-up after epidural."

uh , the referral i have is for abdominal pain and diarrhea .\n[patient] right . so i've had ... i've been having this pain right here in my stomach , like right around here .\n[doctor] so in the area of your mid abdomen , just below the belly button ?\n[patient] correct . i've had the pain on and off for about two years . i finally went to the er and a ... a few months ago and they did a ct scan .\n[doctor] i saw that .\n[patient] yeah . they said they did n't really see anything on the scan .\n[doctor] yes , i agree . it looked normal .\n[patient] the problem is i'm either constipated or have explosive diarrhea .\n[doctor] is the pain there all the time ?\n[patient] it's a nagging feeling and it just depends . sometimes it bothers me , sometimes it does n't .\n[doctor] has this been the case over the past two years as well ?\n[patient] more recently in the past couple months , at least with the constipation and diarrhea .\n[doctor] and before that , how are your bowel movements ?\n[patient] they were normal .\n[doctor] uh , okay . so any blood in your stool ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] do you feel like you have more constipation or diarrhea ?\n[patient] probably more constipation .\n[doctor] okay , so when you're constipated , do you not have a bowel movement or is the stool hard ?\n[patient] i usually do n't go , but when i do , it's hard .\n[doctor] and how often do you have a bowel movement when you are constipated ?\n[patient] about three to four times a week . it's like when i need to go to the bathroom , if i can massage it , it feels like it's moving some and i can eventually go .\n[doctor] okay . and when you have a bowel movement , does the pain change ?\n[patient] yeah , it gets a little better .\n[doctor] and are you eating and drinking okay ? any nausea or vomiting , heartburn or indigestion ?\n[patient] none of that .\n[doctor] okay . so tell me about the diarrhea , how often do you get it ?\n[patient] it kinda just depends on what i eat . i think i have a very sensitive stomach . if i eat pasta with a creamy sauce , i'm probably gon na have diarrhea .\n[doctor] okay . and it does n't happen for multiple days in a row or is it just one time ?\n[patient] it's usually just one time and then it's over .\n[doctor] and how's your weight been ? any fluctuation ?\n[patient] nice and pretty stable , although i could stand to lose about 25 pounds .\n[doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi issues that you know of ?\n[patient] not that i can think of . well , actually my sister does have problems with her stomach too . she has irritable bowel syndrome and that is kind of what i always thought i had even thought i've never been diagnosed with it .\n[doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi cancer or liver disease ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] have you ever had any surgeries on your abdomen ?\n[patient] i've never had any surgery .\n[doctor] okay , so your gallbladder , appendix , all those are still intact ?\n[patient] yup .\n[doctor] and have you ever had a colonoscopy ?\n[patient] no . i thought that happen when you turn 50 .\n[doctor] well , that's for colon cancer screening , but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy , like unexplained abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] well , come have a seat here and lay back so i can examine you .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my steth- stethoscope . and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants .\n[patient] what does that mean ? is everything okay ?\n[doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] so now , i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen . let me know if you have any pain .\n[patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button .\n[doctor] okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ?\n[patient] yes , i have a physical about four months ago and they ... i had blood drawn then .\n[doctor] okay . and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ?\n[patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes , but we would recheck them in about six months .\n[doctor] and you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ?\n[patient] he said the alt and the ast were elevated .\n[doctor] and do you take any medications , either prescription or over-the-counter ?\n[patient] i take crestor and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasion- occasional pain .\n[doctor] and how frequently do you take the tylenol ?\n[patient] hardly ever . maybe once a month .\n[doctor] and do you consume alcohol ?\n[patient] uh , yes , but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on saturdays .\n[doctor] okay . and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] and how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice .\n[patient] what would cause that ?\n[doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted .\n[patient] that's good .\n[doctor] yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly .\n[patient] what's that ?\n[doctor] increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon .\n[patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ?\n[doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged .\n[patient] but you said mine was slightly enlarged ?\n[doctor] correct .\n[patient] so what does that mean ?\n[doctor] well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged .\n[patient] could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ?\n[doctor] no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat . and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that .\n[patient] so what about my liver ? why is it enlarged ?\n[doctor] well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to liver , alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease .\n[patient] so what do i need to do ?\n[doctor] well , i think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs .\n[patient] okay . and then what ?\n[doctor] we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too .\n[patient] which medications ?\n[doctor] crestor , how long have you been taking that ?\n[patient] about 18 months .\n[doctor] okay . well , crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives .\n[patient] should i talk to my primary care or can you change it ?\n[doctor] i would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol .\n[patient] okay . i'll call him this afternoon .\n[doctor] great . i also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound . if your blood work looks good , then we can always cancel that .\n[patient] okay . when do you think i'll be able to get the ultrasound done ?\n[doctor] hopefully , within the next two weeks . you will receive a call from the radiology scheduling this afternoon to get it set up .\n[patient] okay . and then what happens ?\n[doctor] when i get the results from the test , i will contact you . and depending upon what we find , we'll come up with our next steps .\n[patient] and when should i see you again ?\n[doctor] uh , let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in four weeks . we'll discuss how you're doing with the fiber supplement and your constipation and review test results to determine if we need to do further testing on your liver .\n[patient] okay . is there anything else i can do to help with these issues ?\n[doctor] definitely refrain from drinking any alcohol , increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day in addition to taking the fiber supplement to help with your constipation . and be mindful of eating foods that you were sensitive to so you can avoid the bouts of diarrhea .\n[patient] okay . and i'll talk to my primary care about my crestor .\n[doctor] excellent . and do you have any other questions for me ?\n[patient] i do n't think so .\n[doctor] great . so remember when you check out the front desk , schedule follow-up appointment with me for four weeks and then go to the lab to get your blood work drawn .\n[patient] okay . sounds good .\n[doctor] and expect a call from radiology scheduling about setting up your ultrasound .\n[patient] all right . thanks , dr. edwards .\n[doctor] thank you , mr. allen .",
                  "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nAbdominal pain and diarrhea.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nPatrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea.\n\nMr. Allen reports experiencing intermittent mid-abdominal pain for approximately 2 years. The pain is localized just inferior to the umbilicus and he describes it as a “nagging feeling” when it is present. The pain sometimes improves following a bowel movement. Unfortunately, Mr. Allen reports that the pain has been present more often in the past 2 months. In 01/2020, the patient presented to the emergency room due to the pain and underwent a CT scan.\n\nIn addition to the abdominal pain, Mr. Allen complains of constipation and episodic severe diarrhea for the past 2 months; however, he estimates that the constipation is more frequent than the diarrhea. When he is constipated, he has a bowel movement 3-4 times a week and the stools are hard. Regarding his diarrhea, he has noticed that it seems to be associated with certain foods. In particular, he notes that pasta with a creamy sauce is likely to prompt an episode of diarrhea. When this occurs, he usually has just 1 bowel movement of diarrhea and then it resolves. The patient states that, prior to 2 months ago, his bowel movements were normal. Mr. Allen notes that massaging his abdomen has sometimes been helpful in producing a bowel movement.\n\nThe patient’s last physical was 4 months ago, and he confirms that he did have bloodwork that day. Mr. Allen reports that his primary care provider notified him that his AST and ALT were mildly elevated and advised that they would need to recheck his liver enzymes in 6 months. The patient’s medication list includes Crestor and olmesartan daily and he estimates that he has been taking the Crestor for approximately 18 months. He also takes Tylenol as needed for pain, approximately once a month. The patient states that he drinks 2 beers once a week and denies a history of heavy alcohol or drug use. He also denies excessive bruising or bleeding and any lower extremity edema.\n\nThe patient denies blood in his stools, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, and indigestion. He confirms that he is eating and drinking normally, and his weight has been stable. He does acknowledge that he would like to lose 25 pounds, however. He has no family history of gastrointestinal cancer or liver disease; however, his sister has irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The patient has not had any prior abdominal surgeries and he has never had a colonoscopy.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nRespiratory\nLungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.\n\nCardiovascular\nNo murmurs, gallops, or rubs.\n\nAbdomen\nNormoactive bowel sounds in all 4 quadrants. There is mild left periumbilical tenderness to palpation, mild hepatomegaly, and increased stool burden in colon.\n\nRESULTS\n\nCT of Abdomen, 01/23/2020.\nImpression: Normal CT of abdomen.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n• Constipation\n• Mild hepatomegaly\n\nPLAN\n\nPatrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. The most likely etiology of his abdominal pain is constipation given his history, exam with increased stool burden, and normal abdominal CT. Mild hepatomegaly was also noted on exam today and the patient reportedly had elevated liver enzymes on labs with his primary care provider 4 months ago. The patient is currently on Crestor which may be contributing to his elevated liver enzymes. We discussed findings, diagnosis, and next steps at length.\n\nConstipation\n• Start daily fiber supplement and increase water consumption to at least 48 ounces daily to help with bowel regularity.\n• Avoid trigger foods that may cause episodes of diarrhea.\n\nMild Hepatomegaly\n• Repeat liver enzyme labs today.\n• Schedule a liver ultrasound pending lab results.\n• Encouraged to cease alcohol consumption.\n• Patient to contact his PCP to discuss alternative medications.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nReturn to clinic in 4 weeks.\n"

                  "[doctor] next patient is sophia jackson , mrnr472348 . she's a 57 year old female who is here for a surgical consult . her dermatologist referred her . she biopsied a 0.7 millimeter lesion which was located on right inferior back . pathology came back as melanoma .\n[doctor] mrs. jackson , it's good to meet you .\n[patient] likewise , wish it were under better circumstances .\n[doctor] yeah , i hear your dermatologist sent you to me 'cause she found a melanoma ?\n[patient] yes , that's what the biopsy said .\n[doctor] okay and when did you first notice the spot ?\n[patient] my mom noticed it when i was visiting her last month .\n[doctor] i see . and so you went to the dermatologist on april 10th to get it checked out , right ?\n[patient] yes , i wanted to be extra cautious because skin cancer does run in my family .\n[doctor] well i'm really glad you took it seriously and got it checked . who in your family has had skin cancer , and do you know if it was melanoma or was it basal cell or squamous cell ?\n[patient] my mom and her sister , i think they both had melanoma .\n[doctor] okay . do you have any other types of cancer in the family , like breast or ovarian ?\n[patient] my grandfather had pancreatic cancer .\n[doctor] okay , and was that your mom or dad's father ?\n[patient] mother's .\n[doctor] okay . and , um , have you personally had any skin spots in the past that you got checked out and they were cancerous or precancerous ?\n[patient] no , this was the first time i've been to a dermatologist . um , but my primary care doctor looks over all of my moles every year at my physical and has n't said , um , he's concerned about any of 'em before .\n[doctor] good- good . uh , let's go over your medical history from your chart . i have that you're not taking any medications and do n't have any health problems listed , but that you're allergic to augmentin , is that right ?\n[patient] yes , that's correct .\n[doctor] okay , and for social history can you tell me what you do for work ?\n[patient] i own an auto repair shop .\n[doctor] okay and have you ever been a smoker ?\n[patient] yeah , i still smoke from time to time . i started that awful habit in my teens and it's hard to break , but i'm trying .\n[doctor] i'm glad you're trying to quit . uh , what about your surgical history , have you had any surgeries ?\n[patient] i had gall bladder and appendix .\n[doctor] okay , great , we can get your chart up to date now , thank you . and other than the melanoma , how has your health been , any unintentional weight changes , headaches , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , vision changes ?\n[patient] no , i've been feelin' great .\n[doctor] good . well let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you do n't mind .\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] okay , i'm gon na describe it in medical jargon what i'm seeing here , so that the recording can capture it , but you and i are gon na go over it together in just a moment , okay ?\n[patient] okay , that's fine .\n[doctor] all right , so on the right inferior back there's a one centimeter shave biopsy site , including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation . there's no intrinsic or satellite lesions , no other suspicious moles , no axillary , cervical , or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy . there is a soft lymph node in the right groin , but it's nontender , otherwise normal exam .\n[doctor] okay , you can sit up . um , so what i was saying there is that i see your biopsy site , but i do n't see any other s- , um , skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious . uh , i also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal . there is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal . it's very likely nothing , but i do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing , um , and , you know , make sure it's nothing that we need to worry about . uh , the reason we're being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes . the ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further .\n[patient] okay , i should n't worry too much then ?\n[doctor] no , i have a low suspicion that it will show anything .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] so assuming that the ultrasound is normal , the treatment for you melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was . with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less , um , and that's what we recommend , and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters . if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery . but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision , meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site . the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely . you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision .\n[patient] okay , that is fine with me , i ca n't see back there anyways .\n[doctor] yeah , your wife can tell you what it looks like and she may need to help care for the incision at it , as it heals . um , but since we're , we are n't doing the more complex surgery , i actually do n't need to see you back unless you want to check in with me or have any problems . however , it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly so she can monitor you . uh , your dermatologist will check that this one does n't come back , but she'll also check for other lesions that look suspicious . uh , unfortunately , since you've had one melanoma , you're at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else .\n[patient] yeah , she did say she wants to see me back .\n[doctor] good , and i'm sure she's already told you , but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight .\n[patient] yeah , she definitely went over that , um , several times with me .\n[doctor] good . other than that , i think that's all for me . um , we'll get you set up for the ultrasound , the procedure . do you have any questions for me ?\n[patient] um , no i ca n't think of any at this time .\n[doctor] okay , my nurse will be in to get you scheduled , so sit tight . it was very good to meet you .\n[patient] thank you , nice to meet you as well .\n[doctor] please add the following pathology r- , to results . a pathology , shave of right inferior back , malignant melanoma , invasive , superficial spreading . histology , superficial spreading . clark level 4 , breslow thickness 0.7 millimeters , radial growth phase present , vertical growth phase not identified . mitotic features , less than one millimeter squared . ulceration not identified , progression not

She was referred by her dermatologist who biopsied the 0.7 mm lesion on 04/10 and diagnosed the melanoma. The lesion was initially noticed by the patient’s mother when she was visiting her last month. Mrs. Jackson denies a personal history of atypical nevi and reports that she has annual mole checks by her primary care provider at her physicals. She has never seen a dermatologist prior to last month. There is a family history of melanoma in her mother and maternal aunt.

'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too .\n[patient] i did .\n[doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone .\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also .\n[patient] yeah . and before , in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof . which then , i knew my period was coming . then it turned into my anxiety spiking just at random times .\n[doctor] hmm , okay .\n[patient] and it seemed like it was for no reason .\n[doctor] but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time .\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] all right . so not really a link there , all right .\n[patient] yeah , i do n't know .\n[doctor] yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too .\n[patient] i figured maybe that's what it was .\n[doctor] and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also .\n[patient] yeah , and at work , that's when i first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with covid . in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results . and then we opened the evaluation centers and the covid clinic . so i think it just took a toll on me .\n[doctor] yeah , i can absolutely see that .\n[patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .\n[doctor] well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] have you lost weight ?\n[patient] no , but i stopped taking the camila birth control . my hunger level was at a new high . i mean , i was eating constantly . i felt like , \" what is going on ? \"\n[doctor] all right .\n[patient] and now i am feeling better .\n[doctor] okay , that's good . and your masked face , though , it does look thinner .\n[patient] well , the past six months i have lost some weight .\n[doctor] okay , good . um , anything else going on ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ?\n[patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap .\n[doctor] all right , well , let's just repeat it then .\n[patient] yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe .\n[doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check .\n[patient] okay . i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it . same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad in how it'll impact her when she gets older .\n[doctor] have you had the vaccine ?\n[patient] yes , i have . and so has my son . he , um , has had his first already .\n[doctor] okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do .\n[patient] yeah , i agree .\n[doctor] all right . well , let's complete your exam .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] so let's take a deep breath . and again . all right , you can breathe normally . all right , and take one more deep breath . okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect . and just place your hand above your head . okay , i do feel some little bumps .\n[patient] yeah , but they're not as big as they were .\n[doctor] mm-hmm . okay , in this breast it does feel a little bit denser . does it hurt at all ?\n[patient] it does , where your left hand just was .\n[doctor] okay , right here ?\n[patient] yeah , down here . but whenever i breastfed , it was always sore there too . i had a clog and something else . the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there , unfortunately .\n[doctor] yeah , they are . uh , well now i do n't know , because if it was the progesterone , they would've gone away .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] all right , well just let your knees just op- relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ?\n[patient] yes , and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] uh , but yeah , i use it once a week and it does help .\n[doctor] okay , great . all right , looks good .\n[patient] good .\n[doctor] you can go ahead and sit up .\n[patient] thank you .\n[doctor] all right , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles , and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now .\n[patient] okay . and what could that mean ?\n[doctor] well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there's also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas , those are all benign things . they're annoying and require some workup , but they're all benign .\n[patient] and i'm- i'm just worried because i'm almost 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . so i mean , i know there's nothing i can do about it , but it's just i feel like , uh , we had it under control and now it is n't .\n[doctor] well , i would n't say that . i mean , i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things , and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before , and things actually have n't changed .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] so those are all good things .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] because , um , if it was cancer , we'd actually , we would see some change .\n[patient] we would ? okay , thank you for explaining that .\n[doctor] yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing , but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue , and it's annoying that we have to follow them .\n[patient] yeah , i agree there .\n[doctor] um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it .\n[patient] okay . i'll do whatever you think i should .\n[doctor] all right . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule .\n[patient] okay , i think that sounds great .\n[doctor] all right . i do too . all right , well any questions or anything else we can discuss today ?\n[patient] no , i think i'm all set .\n[doctor] all right , good . all right , well have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else .\n[patient] all right , thank you . you have a good day too .\n[doctor] all right .",
                  "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow-up bilateral breast cysts.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nDonna Torres is a 40-year-old female who presents for follow-up surveillance of bilateral breast cysts.\n\nThe patient reports continual presence of “lumps” in bilateral breasts with some soreness. She is being seen today for surveillance of the cysts. The patient is taking progesterone, which was initially prescribed to support normalization of menstruation, which was effective. She is also still using vaginal cream one time per week which has improved symptoms of itching and discomfort.\n\nHer last pap smear was in 2019, with negative/negative results. She did have an abnormal pap smear in 2009, which resulted in repeat pap smears per 6 months until her results normalized.\n\nMrs. Torres experienced increased anxiety in 11/2021 and 12/2021, stating “it was brutal” and felt she could not manage her symptoms and sought treatment. Dr. Brown started the patient on Buspar, which has successfully controlled her anxiety. The patient relates her anxiety to work related stress and possibly aging. Her work involves supporting Covid evaluation centers and clinics. She confirms receiving both Covid vaccinations. Initially, she was experiencing spikes in anxiety prior to menstruation, but her anxiety then became more random with an unclear cause. To note, the patient was started on Singulair, which the patient was told could also cause anxiety.\n\nThe patient discontinued Camila birth control, which did result in a significant increase in appetite. This has resolved and she reports she has lost weight in the past 6 months.\n\nGynecologic History\nLast pap smear: 2019.\nHistory of abnormal pap smear: 2009.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nBilateral breast cysts.\nAnxiety.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nEmployed in healthcare, supports Covid evaluation centers and clinics.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nMother, deceased age 45, from complications of breast cancer.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nBuspar.\nSingulair.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGenitourinary\nBreast: Breast density.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n• Follow-up bilateral breast cysts.\n• Pap smear.\n\nPLAN\n\nFollow-up bilateral breast cysts\nPhysical exam indicated stable breast density bilaterally.

.\n[doctor] hello , ms. brown .\n[patient] hi . yes , that's me .\n[doctor] wonderful . i'm doctor stewart . it's lovely to meet you .\n[patient] you as well .\n[doctor] so , you've come to see me today because you had a right breast lumpectomy last year . is that right ?\n[patient] yes . on january 20th , 2020 .\n[doctor] okay . and how have you been since then ? any problems or concerns ?\n[patient] no , i'm feeling good . i do my self breast exams religiously now and have n't felt anything since .\n[doctor] perfect . i want to back up and go over your history so i can make sure everything in your chart is correct and i do n't miss anything . so , i'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing . sound good ?\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ?\n[patient] it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often .\n[doctor] i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters .\n[patient] yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though .\n[doctor] yep , definitely .\n[doctor] based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ .\n[patient] yes . unfortunately .\n[doctor] i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great !\n[patient] yeah , i was definitely very relieved .\n[doctor] and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal .\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay . so , i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now . and you're here today to establish care with me so i can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well , right ?\n[patient] yes . fingers crossed .\n[doctor] definitely . we'll keep a close eye on you and take good care of you .\n[patient] okay , sounds good .\n[doctor] i have a few more questions for you . when was your last colonoscopy ?\n[patient] i had one in 2018 and , if i remember correctly , i had one polyp and that was removed and it was n't cancerous .\n[doctor] okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ?\n[patient] gosh . it was probably around 30 years ago .\n[doctor] okay . do you have children ?\n[patient] i do . i have five .\n[doctor] ah , big family then . that's nice .\n[patient] yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger .\n[doctor] i bet . sounds like fun .\n[patient] it is .\n[doctor] did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ?\n[patient] really , i did not .\n[doctor] okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ?\n[patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .\n[doctor] okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those .\n[patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .\n[doctor] okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ?\n[patient] that's correct .\n[doctor] okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ?\n[patient] yes , and that's all .\n[doctor] okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ?\n[patient] i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all .\n[doctor] okay . and how about family history ?\n[patient] my mom had non-hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease , but i think that's it .\n[doctor] all right . any family history of breast cancer ?\n[patient] none .\n[doctor] did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems ?\n[patient] i do not have any siblings and , thankfully , my children are all healthy .\n[doctor] wonderful . do you have any history of smoking , illicit drug use , heavy alcohol consumption ?\n[patient] no drugs . i do drink socially , but never more than that . and i used to smoke , but really , everybody did back then and i probably quit about 30 years ago .\n[doctor] excellent . i have that you're allergic to penicillin . any other allergies ?\n[patient] nope , just penicillin .\n[doctor] okay . i think that covers it . hop up here and let me take a look at you .\n[doctor] okay , so let's use the normal new patient exam template . only change to make is the breast exam . there are no palpable masses , however , there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes .\n[doctor] in the result section , note that her ecog performance status today is zero .\n[doctor] do you have ... did you have radiation after the lumpectomy ?\n[patient] i did . we also talked about endocrine therapy , but i decided against that .\n[doctor] okay . so your exam looks good , no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now , let's go over the plan for you .\n[patient] okay , sounds good .\n[doctor] as you know , you've had dcis which we'll list in my note as stage zero , er/pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had , um , radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy and your mammogram in january , 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy .\n[doctor] so , based on all of that , we can just continue to observe you .\n[patient] okay . that sounds great . and when do i come back in to see you ?\n[doctor] in a year , but you should have another mammogram in april of 2022 before you come back to see me .\n[patient] okay , i can do that .\n[doctor] wonderful . i'm glad to see you doing so well . do you have any questions or concerns i can address for you today ?\n[patient] i do n't think so .\n[doctor] okay , great . my nurse will be in shortly to discharge you . take care !\n[patient] you as well .",

                  "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight hip pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nElizabeth Reyes is a 56-year-old female who presents for the evaluation of pain in her right hip and groin region. Her symptoms started on 02/2020 and has progressively worsened. She is employed as an RN and notes that her symptoms began while she was working and walking around the infusion room at Johnson. Initially the pain would only happen when she took a step back, but the pain has progressed and now occurs with any type of movement involving her right hip and groin. She describes that her hip will sometimes “catch” when she moves, causing her to fall on occasion. The pain improves when she is still and stops moving. She rates her pain as 2-7/10.\n\nStarting in 2018, the patient intentionally lost 110 pounds through Weight Watchers. She has maintained the weight loss and her weight has been stabile for the past 1 year. She has a history of several bulging discs, but the pain has significantly reduced due to her weight loss.

Range of motion is full in all planes without pain. Spurling's test is negative.\nLumbar spine exam: Range of motion is decreased in extension and lateral flexion without pain. No tenderness is elicited in the midline.\nSacroiliac joint exam: Bilateral sacroiliac joints are nontender to palpation.\nBilateral hip exam: Range of motion is decreased in the right hip with pain in the groin on internal and external rotation. Resisted right hip flexion causes pain in the right groin region. Bilateral trochanteric regions are nontender to palpation.\n\nNeurological\nMotor bulk and tone are normal in both lower extremities. Motor strength testing reveals no focal motor weakness in the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ throughout. No focal sensory deficit is noted.\n\nRESULTS\n\nMR arthrogram of the right hip completed on 06/03/2021 reveals evidence of high-grade chondromalacia involving the anterosuperior right acetabulum with subchondral marrow edema and cyst formation.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n• Right hip degenerative joint disease.\n\nPLAN\n\nI discussed the clinical and radiological findings with the patient. Treatment options discussed are low impact exercises, use of analgesics as needed, and use of a cane to offload the right hip. She would like to proceed with a cortisone injection into her right hip joint. We will administer the injection today. I reviewed the procedure in detail, including the risks of the injection related to the use of steroid in the COVID setting. She understands the risks and would like to proceed with the injection.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nSchedule a follow up appointment in 3 months to assess her pain. If needed, a second injection may be administered.\n"

                  "[doctor] alright you can go ahead\n[patient] hey alan i good to see you today so i looked here my appointment notes and i see that you're coming in you had some shoulder pain left shoulder pain for the last three weeks so\n[doctor] how you doing is it is it gotten any better\n[patient] yeah yeah i've been having a lot of pain of my shoulder for the last three weeks now and it's not getting better okay do you remember what you were doing when the pain first started\n[doctor] so i i was thinking that i i ca n't recall like falling on it injuring it getting hit\n[patient] hmmm\n[doctor] i have been doing a lot of work in my basement and i even i put in a new ceiling so i do n't know if it's from all that activity doing that but otherwise that's that's all i can think of\n[patient] okay so do you remember hitting it or anything like that\n[doctor] no nothing at all\n[patient] okay alright did you fall do you remember doing that\n[doctor] no\n[patient] okay hmmm so like a little mystery so have you had pain in that shoulder before\n[doctor] i mean i'm very active so i can get pains in my shoulders but it's nothing that sometime some tylenol can help\n[patient] okay and are you able to move the arm or is it kinda just stuck\n[doctor] i'm having a lot of pain like i can move it but you know when i try to reach for something lifting anything and even like i do n't even try to put my hands over my head because it causes so much pain\n[patient] alright so does that pain radiate anywhere or like where would you say it is in your shoulder\n[doctor] it actually it stays pretty much just right at the shoulder it does n't go down anywhere\n[patient] okay and the pain is it is it all the time or does it come and go\n[doctor] it's pretty much all the time anytime i put any pressure on it like when i'm trying to sleep it hurts even more so it's been affecting my sleep as well\n[patient] okay so i know you mentioned tylenol so this time i have n't taken anything for it\n[doctor] yeah i i do the tylenol which usually works for me and it does take the edge off but i still have pain okay did you try icing it at all\n[patient] i iced it initially but i have n't iced it at all recently\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] and so with your shoulder have you experienced any numbness in your arm or in your fingers\n[doctor] no numbness or tingling\n[patient] okay good so i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam and take a look at your your shoulder so i reviewed your your vitals everything looks good with that so touch here in your shoulder so your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion so pressure here so that there is tenderness of the greater\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] tuberosity of the humerus let's see there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] acromioclavicular joints\n[doctor] yeah yeah\n[patient] and looks like you have good hand grip let me see so on the neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is is intact to light touch\n[doctor] yes thank you yep\n[patient] so you did get a we get we had to get a x-ray of your shoulder before you came in and so it's normal so that's really good so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you you do have that left shoulder pain so your symptoms are\n[doctor] most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured tendon you have injured tendons and muscles that make up your shoulder and make up your shoulder muscles so what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na order an mri of your left shoulder\n[patient] and so we're gon na begin with that just to make sure nothing else is going on have you done physical therapy before\n[doctor] i have n't\n[patient] okay so what i'm gon na do i'm going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so they can help you strengthen those muscles around your shoulder and that should definitely help with the pain during that time you can also continue to take tylenol i do n't think i need to prescribe anything else for the pain you said as it's working pretty good for you so if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which should provide some relief but i think right now we can just go with the the pt and hopefully that works to alleviate your injury so do you have any questions about the plan\n[doctor] so like i said i'm really active do you think that this pain will ever go away\n[patient] yeah so many patients are very successful with rehab and so we'll start with that and see how you do most most of the time once we build up those muscles around that shoulder you know things things the pain alleviates itself and and and you will be good to go back to working on your basement and running and jogging and lifting weights all all the active things people do these days\n[doctor] okay alright thank you\n[patient] bye\n[doctor] okay bye",
                  "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nLeft shoulder pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAlan Mitchell is a pleasant 69-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain. The onset of his pain began 3 weeks ago, without any improvement. He denies any specific injury; however, he has been renovating his basement and putting in a new ceiling. He does not recall hitting or falling onto the left shoulder. The patient states he is very active and has experienced left shoulder pain before that usually resolves with Tylenol.\n\nThe patient reports significant pain with reaching, lifting, and overhead activities. The pain is constant. He states the pain is primarily located in the left shoulder and denies it radiates down into the left arm. The patient also reports difficulty sleeping secondary to the pain. He denies any numbness or tingling in his left arm or fingers. He has been taking Tylenol for pain, which provides partial relief. He initially iced his shoulder but has not iced it recently. The patient denies he has done any physical therapy.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain. Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling.\n\nVITALS\n\nAll vital signs are within the normal limits.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or AC joints. Good hand grip. Neurovascularly intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Sensation is intact to light touch distally.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays of the left shoulder were obtained and reviewed today. These are normal and reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLeft shoulder pain, likely rotator cuff tendinopathy.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. I have explained that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the left shoulder to evaluate for possible rotator cuff tendinopathy. The patient was provided with a referral to formal physical therapy. He will engage in a 6-to-8-week course in order to strengthen his left shoulder. I have also advised him to take Tylenol as needed for pain. If his symptoms do not improve, we may consider a steroid injection to the left shoulder.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion."

pressures and what you've eaten if if your blood pressure seems a little high also weigh yourself daily and call me if you gain three pounds in two days okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] and i also want you to see a nutritionist to give you some education about what foods you can eat okay now for your second problem for i know this sounds like this is just for you and so for your second problem for your hypertension i want you to continue on the cozaar one hundred milligrams daily continue on the norvasc five milligrams once daily also and i'm going to order a renal artery ultrasound just to be sure we're not missing anything and then like maybe you know some renal artery stenosis or something and so so for your third problem for your kidney disease i wan na get some more labs to make sure

landscaping okay so a lot of raking a lot of digging so a lot of repetitive type movements\n[patient] yeah it's pretty heavy labor but it's yeah the same thing day in and day out\n[doctor] okay okay just a couple questions for you you did say that you have the pain at night in that and you have to you get that numbness into the hand is it in all the fingers\n[patient] yeah it seems to happen to all my fingers but i notice it more in my thumb and pointer finger\n[doctor] okay okay and anything into that little into your fifth finger your little finger any numbness there at times no\n[patient] sometimes yeah it seems like it's numb too\n[doctor] okay what about your right hand any problems with that hand\n[patient] no i do n't seem to have any problems with my right hand so far it's just mostly my left\n[doctor] okay okay good and just a couple you know do you how do you have many or do you drink often do you have you know many any alcohol consumption\n[patient] i drink usually a a beer or two on fridays and saturdays on the weekends\n[doctor] okay and do you have any evidence of any anybody ever said that you had some rheumatoid arthritis in your hand or wrist anything like that\n[patient] no nobody say anything like that so i mean\n[doctor] okay okay good so let me go ahead and do a physical exam here real quick and you know i'm gon na quickly just listen to your heart and lungs okay that's good i'd like you to squeeze i'm gon na hold your hands here and i'd like you to squeeze both hands\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] you seem a little bit weaker on that left hand is that what you've noticed\n[patient] yeah i i i experienced some weakness in my left hand\n[doctor] okay do you you find that you're dropping things when you're picking it up is it to that level or\n[patient] yeah i drop things mostly because i have a hard time feeling it\n[doctor] okay okay good and so you you do have a a grip strength is less on the left and i just wan na touch your fingers here on the on the right side you can feel me touching all the fingers on the right\n[patient] yeah i can i can say you touch me but it feels a little more weird on the thumb side than my pointer finger side\n[doctor] okay okay and i wan na turn your wrist over here and turn your hand over and i'm gon na go ahead and tap on the right wrist on the back here does that do anything when i do that\n[patient] i still i feel a little jolt or a zing in my finger tips\n[doctor] okay and then when i do that on the left side\n[patient] yeah same thing\n[doctor] same thing okay so you do have a bilateral positive tinel's sign so so here's here's where i'm at i think your your diagnosis is beginning to have some bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome usually we see that with repetitive actions such as the landscaping the heavy labor and you you know your your clinical exam and and history sound like it's a carpal tunnel syndrome i do want to order so where are we gon na go from here i would like to order a a study it's called an emg where it it measures some of that electrical impulses down into your fingers we will follow up with that but as far as your treatment so the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is really some activity modification now i know you are a landscaper is there any way that you could be work to have some lighter work during the time\n[patient] i suppose i could try to pass it off to some of my other employes and delegate\n[doctor] okay that would be good so that's i i just want you to kinda eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks i'm also gon na give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and i'd like you to take ibuprofen six hundred milligrams every six hours and then i wan na see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period i think we're gon na see if there's need for any other intervention if i need to do more diagnostic testing or if there is a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a a good plan for you\n[patient] yeah it sounds like a good first start\n[doctor] okay okay so i i just just off off the record here what kind of what do what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do\n[patient] mostly like yard work and maintenance flower beds not really designing just up keep\n[doctor] okay yeah i'm looking for a landscape designer i need somebody to put in some elaborate walkways back through the backyard so yeah we can do stuff like that i mean if you have an idea what you want i think that's easy\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] you know if you're looking for like some\n[patient] backyard elasis rehab remodel that's i mean i suppose we could do we have n't done things like that in a while because we're busy enough with just the up key but it's something to explore\n[doctor] okay yeah i may have to keep that in mind because i do wan na do some of that so let's listen i'm gon na get my my nurse in here to discharge you do you have any other questions for me before we end this\n[patient] no i think it's all clear i appreciate it\n[doctor]

He reports an onset of a few months ago but denies any specific injury. However, the patient notes he often engages in repetitive motions while performing his work duties. His symptoms are worse at night, and he wakes with numbness in the bilateral hands. He experiences numbness in all fingers, but states it is the most noticeable in the left thumb and index finger. He affirms intermittent numbness in the left little finger. For relief, he shakes his hands upon waking. The patient also experiences weakness in his left hand. He reports he drops objects and explains “I have a hard time feeling it.”\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient denies a history of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nHe works in landscaping. He reports consuming 1 to 2 beers on weekends.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports left wrist and hand pain. Denies right hand pain.\nNeurological: Reports numbness in bilateral hands and fingers, and left hand weakness.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNEURO: Decreased sensation in the right thumb and index finger.\nMSK: Examination of the bilateral hands: Grip strength is less on the left in comparison to the right. Positive Tinel sign bilaterally.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nBilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's clinical history and examination today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding treatment options for his current symptoms. I discussed the importance of activity modification and encouraged the patient to limit active repetitive motions while working for the next 2 weeks. I also recommended that he wear a wrist splint to provide increased support. I advised him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours. Additionally, I recommended we obtain an EMG of the bilateral upper extremities to evaluate for carpal tunnel syndrome. The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks when the EMG results are available for review. If at that time his symptoms have not improved with these conservative measures, we will discuss further treatment options including additional diagnostic testing or possible surgical intervention.\n\nThe patient states he understands and is in agreement with the plan. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks."

have any headaches\n[patient] really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis\n[doctor] okay what about chest pain\n[patient] no chest pain\n[doctor] shortness of breath\n[patient] no shortness of breath\n[doctor] even with exertion\n[patient] even with exertion\n[doctor] okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed\n[patient] not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no\n[doctor] okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure\n[patient] both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease\n[doctor] okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on\n[patient] yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on\n[doctor] okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve\n[patient] yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday\n[doctor] okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for\n[patient] i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends\n[doctor] okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me\n[patient] no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control\n[doctor] yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan\n[patient] that sounds good thank you\n[doctor] okay take care i'll talk to you later\n[patient] okay alright bye",

sorry you're having headaches well let's talk about it but i would like to record this conversation with this app that's gon na help me focus on you more would that be okay with you\n[patient] yes that's okay\n[doctor] okay great thanks so carolyn tell me about your headache and headache or headaches when did when did they start and and what symptoms are you having\n[patient] my headache started about a week ago it's feeling like a dull pain in the back of my head i have flushing in my ears they get really red and hot and sometimes i just feel a little bit dizzy when i get these headaches but i've taken tylenol and advil and it's not really going away it just keeps coming back\n[doctor] okay and alright and so this started about a week ago has it been fairly constant since it started or does it come and go does it come and go or what\n[patient] it comes and goes i it it's relieved when i take my tylenol or advil but then it comes right back\n[doctor] hmmm okay and do you notice any any timing difference you know is it is it worse in the morning worse in the evening is there anything else that makes it better or worse\n[patient] it's definitely worse in the evening\n[doctor] okay and do you feel any sort of tightness in the back of your neck or in your shoulders or you know you said it's in the back of your head primarily any discomfort anywhere else\n[patient] yes no just in the back of my head\n[doctor] okay and did the headache start all of a sudden carolyn or has it been gradual or what\n[patient] i've been under a lot of stress lately so maybe about when some stress started occurring\n[doctor] okay okay and alright and have you noticed any fever along with the headache\n[patient] no no fever\n[doctor] okay and any visual changes you know wavy lines in your vision spots in your vision or anything like that\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and have you had headaches like this before\n[patient] i have\n[doctor] okay so this is n't the worst headache you've ever had what did you say\n[patient] no it's not\n[doctor] okay alright and so okay fair enough now how's your diabetes been been been doing lately have you what have your blood sugars been running in the low one hundreds or two hundreds or what\n[patient] i have n't been checking my blood sugars\n[doctor] really okay well we will get you back on that and and we can talk about that but how about your metformin are you still taking the five hundred milligrams once a day no actually it looks like we increased your metformin to five hundred milligrams twice a day last visit are you still taking that\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay great and okay you're still watching your diet and getting some exercise\n[patient] i have not been eating well because i've been stressed over the last week but i have n't been exercising for maybe the past week but generally i've been doing better\n[doctor] okay the headache has has maybe made you feel uncomfortable and prevented your your exercise would you say or what\n[patient] yes it has\n[doctor] okay okay so you probably have n't been out golfing i remember you're a big golfer so not not lately uh so you know being\n[patient] not lately\n[doctor] being down being down here in florida we got ta get get some golf in so hey did you see the masters by the way a few weeks ago was n't that i do n't know did you happen to catch it\n[patient] i did\n[doctor] yeah that was crazy what a what a finish what an amazing what an amazing tournament right what do you think yeah yeah that's great well we'll we'll get you feeling better and get you back out there and now are you still working a lot on the computer ac or\n[patient] i am\n[doctor] carolyn okay yeah you're still working a lot on the computer for work okay are you taking breaks every hour or so you know get up stand around walk stand walk around that can be helpful\n[patient] no i really do n't get the opportunity to\n[doctor] hmmm okay understood alright well listen let's go ahead and examine you okay so so on your physical exam your physical exam is pretty normal unremarkable for the most part and you know few things a few exceptions so first of all on your heent exam your eye exam your extraocular motions are intact without pain you have a funduscopic exam that shows no papilledema that's good that just means there's no swelling in the back of your eye and on your neck exam you do have some posterior mild posterior paraspinal muscular tenderness in the cervical spine and in bilateral trapezius musculature as well and some tightness in those muscles as well and otherwise on your exam let's see your heart exam on your heart exam you have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam so it just means i hear some sounds in your heart as it's beating and i'm not too worried about that we'll watch that and otherwise normal heart exam and and your physical examination otherwise is normal and unremarkable and so now let's talk about my assessment and your plan so carolyn for your first problem of the headache i do think that you have a tension type headache and i think this because you've got some tension and tightness in your paraspinal muscles meaning the muscles around your neck and your shoulders and you know working at the computer i think is contributing to this and also probably the stress so you can continue to take that tylenol for the pain i'm also gon na give you a mild muscle relaxant i'll write you for flexeril five milligrams three times a day and you can take that that will help relax those muscles in your neck and that should help with the symptoms i want you to come back or give us a call if the headaches become more severe or suddenly worsen or you develop a fever but i do n't think that this is a a sign of a stroke or any bleeding in your brain or anything like that i think it's more related to tightness in your muscles in your neck now for your second problem of your diabetes mellitus let's continue you on the metformin five hundred milligrams i am going to order a hemoglobin a1c and also a cbc and a chem-12 to check some of your blood tests blood chemistries and so forth and we will continue you on the metformin i do want you to check your blood sugars daily and that will be very helpful so when you come back in a month i want you to bring those numbers with you we can talk about it again and please do try to get back into your exercise routine that's really gon na help you keep those blood sugars under control as well okay so how does that sound for a plan any other questions for me\n[patient] well would it so only call if if it gets worse or not any better\n[doctor] yeah that that just right but also let's set up an appointment in four weeks and i wan na see you back in four weeks if it's not if the headache is not better within the next few days with this flexeril then you can give us a call and and get back in later this week or early next but definitely if things get worse give us a call sooner and you know i meant to ask you on i wanted to ask if you had a history of any any trauma meaning have you hit your head or you have n't fallen hit your head or anything like that have you\n[patient] no no i think it's just stress\n[doctor] okay alright understood okay great well then i'll see you back in a month if not before okay you take care of yourself nice seeing you\n[patient] thank you\n[doctor] sure",

                  "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight ankle pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nCarolyn Jones is a pleasant 38-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right ankle pain.\n\nThe patient sustained an injury to her right ankle when she slipped and fell on ice while taking her garbage out yesterday. This was her first right ankle injury. She believes she heard a pop at the time, but denies any associated numbness or tingling. Initially, she was unable to bear weight on the ankle and required help getting inside; however, she is now able to slightly bear weight but ambulates with an antalgic gait. Ice, elevation, and ibuprofen have been helpful at reducing her pain. She rates her current pain as 4/10, her pain without medication as 6/10, and her pain with medication as 1/10.\n\nOf note, the patient participates in an intramural soccer league but has not been able to play since this injury.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient reports that she has had several ankle injuries in the past. This is her first right ankle injury.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient reports that she has a history of playing sports. She played soccer in college and is now in an intramural soccer league.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nThe patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right ankle pain.\nNeurological: Denies right ankle numbness or tingling.\n\nVITALS\n\nNormal\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGAIT: antalgic gait\nCV: Brisk capillary refill to less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.\nNEURO: Sensation in the right ankle is intact to light touch distally.\nMSK: Examination of the right ankle: Ecchymosis over the lateral malleolus associated with trace edema in that area. Tenderness to palpation over the anterolateral soft tissue. No laxity on anterior drawer testing or inversion stress testing. No bony tenderness on palpation of the foot or ankle area. Findings are consistent bilaterally.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray images of the right ankle were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLateral ligament complex sprain, Right ankle.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, her symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex, more specifically the anterior talofibular ligament. We had a lengthy discussion regarding the nature of this injury and the course of treatment. I advised her to keep her leg elevated when she is seated and continue to ice her ankle. She should also continue taking ibuprofen as-needed for pain and inflammation management. She will be placed in an Aircast to help stabilize her ankle, and I am going to order crutches so she can remain non-weight-bearing for the next couple of days. At that point, she can start bearing weight on the ankle as tolerated.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up in 2 weeks."

almost a year and then things just started getting really stressful at work they started laying people off and i'm happy i still have a job but that also meant that i was responsible for more things so things just got stressful and i and just started picking it up again\n[doctor] well you are absolutely correct you know stress can often be a trigger for things like smoking and drinking have you thought what you would do this time when you encountered the stressful situations\n[patient] yeah i i did n't think about that a lot actually and one thing is i have started learning and trying to do

okay what kind of activities makes the pain feel worse\n[patient] let's see so anytime so if i'm sitting at my desk and i get up i have a lot of pain so anytime from like standing up from sitting for a while or even going up and down the stairs\n[doctor] okay so you work from home\n[patient] i do\n[doctor] okay okay so there is a lot of desk setting at home is your office upstairs or is it i mean do you have to go up or downstairs to get to it\n[patient] no well first thing in the morning but otherwise it's downstairs\n[doctor] okay okay how do you like working from home\n[patient] you know it has it's plus and minuses\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i like it though my i like my commute\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] i love it\n[doctor] and the parking i'm sure the parking is\n[patient] and the parking is great\n[doctor] yeah i you know if i could do telehealth visits all day long i would be totally happy with that yeah and just set it home and do those so you mentioned is there anything that makes that pain feel better\n[patient] usually after like if i feel that pain and then i just it does get better\n[doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past what have what are they and did they work at all\n[patient] yeah i've done some ibuprofen or aleve sometimes some tylenol and that does help\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it takes the edge off\n[doctor] okay but you're never really pain free is that what i hear you saying\n[patient] not really unless i'm like really just resting which i hate to do but otherwise any type of movement especially from sitting it causes pain\n[doctor] okay so are you active other than going up and down the steps to your office\n[patient] very i'm a big runner i love to run i run about five to six miles a day but with this knee with with these knee pain that i've been having it's i barely can even do half a mile\n[doctor] yeah you know what that's that's i am a biker and i know that once you get that into your you know you have loved doing that activity it's so frustrating when you ca n't it's almost like a it's almost like a dry it almost becomes a drug when you get up\n[patient] exactly\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] it's\n[doctor] okay so have you noticed any redness or swelling in your knees\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and have you ever injured your knees before\n[patient] you know despite how active i am i you know i've never\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] injured or broken a bone\n[doctor] okay great so let's go ahead and do a i just wan na take a look here i reviewed your vitals and overall they look good your blood pressure is one twenty over seventy your your heart rate is sixty and your respiratory rate is fourteen those are all phenomenal numbers as i listened to your heart it is at a regular and a slower rate but i do n't hear any extra sounds so there is no murmurs as we go through that now on musculoskeletal exam you have a normal gait i watched you you know kinda walk in here this morning your strength i just wan na check it when i go ahead and i want you to move your leg okay your muscle strength is is good you do have a three out of five for abduction of your legs bilaterally and that's you know kinda bringing your legs in the remainder of your muscle strength for your lower extremities is a five out of five now let me focus specifically on your knee examination i do n't see any redness or ecchymosis or warmth of the skin and those are big words you know i do n't see any bruising or or that redness there is no effusion that's just like a fluid underneath the knee i do n't appreciate that any at all you do seem to have some tenderness when i palpate and you do have a positive patellar grind test when you stood up i could feel that as we went through there you did say you had that knee pain with squatting but your lachman your anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray test are all negative bilaterally neurologically and your your your lower extremities your patella and your achilles reflex are symmetrical and that's good so i did review the x-rays of both your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so based on what you told me and reviewing the mri that you had done before you came in your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a really common condition that we see that causes knee knee pain especially in really active young people that's probably why i do n't get it when i'm riding my bike forever and ever now this condition has to do with the way your kneecap moves across along the groove of your thigh bone your femur so for pain i want you to continue to take the ibuprofen or any other anti-inflammatories you know aleve or any of those as you need it to help with the pain now i am going to recommend physical therapy well they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises this is probably one of the best things that you can do and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you might have do you have any questions for me\n[patient] so will i be able to run again\n[doctor] absolutely my goal is to get you out there and maybe we can cross pads on the the bike trail some day you are gon na have to take it a little bit easy for now but we are gon na get you back and once we do that i think you will be really pleased is there anything else\n[patient] no i think that's it\n[doctor] okay have a great day\n[patient] okay you too\n[doctor] thank you\n[patient] bye",

have n't been doing longer distances because\n[patient] when i'm running i my right knee here it just starts to ache and it's it's just to the point where i need your opinion\n[doctor] okay okay what have you done for it so far what makes it better what makes it worse\n[patient] well it used to be that when i run it ache and then i put ice on it and then it would be okay so i do ice and ibuprofen\n[doctor] okay okay and did you see anybody for this before coming into the office here\n[patient] yeah i doctor wood is my primary care provider and i talked to him about it actually over the years and this last visit he said he referred me to you\n[doctor] okay okay good so ice and rest makes it feel better running and and activity makes it hurt a little bit more is that correct\n[patient] yeah that's right\n[doctor] okay do you have any family history of arthritis or any of those type of immune diseases\n[patient] i'm trying to think no i do n't think so no\n[doctor] okay and do you get is it is this primarily worse in the morning or does it is it just there all the time when it comes on\n[patient] it actually is worse towards the end of the day\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] once i'm on my feet all day it starts to ache towards the afternoon\n[doctor] okay so let's go ahead and i want to do a quick examination here your blood pressure and was one twenty over sixty that's phenomenal your heart rate was fifty eight and you can tell that you're a runner with that that level of a heart rate and your respirations were fourteen so all of that looked very good there was no fever when you came in when i'm gon na just quickly listen to your heart and lungs okay those those sound good but let me get let's focus here on your lower extremities i'm i'm gon na look at your your left knee first when i move your left knee do you get any type of pain or is it just feel like normal and it's always your pain's always isolated to the right\n[patient] that feels that feels normal\n[doctor] okay okay so let me i just want you to back up here in the stretcher a little bit more and i'm just gon na do some movement of your knee any okay so i want you to push your leg out against my hand does that hurt\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and if you pull back does that hurt a little bit\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and i'm gon na move it around so when i look at the knee there is no redness there's no swelling i can appreciate a a small amount of effusion and that means that there's a little bit of fluid under the knee or in that knee's joint space and there is there is several reasons that could be now when i push on your knee does it hurt more on the inside or does it hurt more on the outside here\n[patient] the the right knee here hurts on the outside\n[doctor] okay okay and you've got a good pedal pulse so you know you can feel that and when i touch your feet you do n't have any numbness or tingling or anything like that\n[patient] no uh uh\n[doctor] okay well so what i want to tell you is that i think you have a knee sprain from overuse and we see that sometimes in runners now unfortunately you're gon na have to take some a little bit of time off of of active running but i do n't think it will be that long until we can get you up and running again now i reviewed the x-rays that we did when you first came into the office here

                  "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nNew patient evaluation of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nThe patient was adopted and has no knowledge of any family history.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Reports unintentional weight loss\nGastrointestinal: Reports abdominal pain and constipation. Denies vomiting.\nGenitourinary: Reports abnormal vaginal bleeding. Denies urinary issues.\nPsychiatric: Reports depression\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGastrointestinal\n- Examination of Abdomen: There is slight tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant. No rebounding or guarding.\n\nPelvic\n- Examination: There are no external lesions on the labia. The vaginal vault is within normal limits. The cervix is pink without lesions. On bimanual exam, I appreciate a left adnexal mass. No masses on the right.\n\nRESULTS\n\nCT scan of the abdomen was reviewed and demonstrated a 3 cm left ovarian mass with associated localized lymph node involvement. There is no evidence of gross peritoneal or metastatic disease.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\n1. Ovarian cancer.\n- Medical Reasoning: Looking at her abdominal CT results, it appears to be stage IIIA disease based on the lymph node involvement.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient that the typical approach to treating this stage of cancer is surgical intervention followed by adjunct chemotherapy. The procedure and subsequent chemotherapy plans were discussed in detail. Given that she is young and otherwise healthy, I reassured her that I believe her prognosis is favorable based on her current status, however, this is dependent on the final pathology report. All of her questions were answered.\n- Medical Treatment: I want to start by ordering several blood tests including a CA-125, hCG, AFP, and LDH. I also want her to undergo genetic counseling and testing to see if she has a genetic predisposition for developing ovarian cancer. I recommend we perform a hysterectomy and oophorectomy, as well as a lymph node dissection to remove any involved lymph nodes. Any concerning tissue will be biopsied and sent to pathology for staging. After she has recovered from surgery, she will start chemotherapy treatment with cisplatin and Taxol. We may also consider intraperitoneal chemotherapy.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."

know volley the ball\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] it was like a double game and i was trying to volley the ball and i got in front of another player and actually ended up falling on top of my foot\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] and then yeah it kinda hurt i quickly then twisted my myself around her because i was trying to catch myself but then i started to feel some pain in my foot\n[doctor] mm-hmm okay have you ever injured that foot before\n[patient] yeah no sorry i injured my other foot before not this foot\n[doctor] okay so right now you're experiencing right leg pain but you have injured your your left leg before is that what i'm hearing\n[patient] yeah that's fine\n[doctor] alright were you able to continue playing\n[patient] no i had to stop i actually it was like i had to be held from the field because i could n't put weight on my foot\n[doctor] i'm sorry okay so what have you been doing for the pain since then\n[patient] i wrapped it after a the game they had some ace wraps in their clubhouse and so i wrapped it up and then i iced it last night and i just kept it up on a pillow and then i took some ibuprofen\n[doctor] okay could you one more time when did this injury happen\n[patient] this happened about couple days ago\n[doctor] okay so did you say whether does the ibuprofen help at all\n[patient] yeah it helps a little bit but then you know it it you know after a while it wears out\n[doctor] okay and then have you experienced any numb numbness or tingling\n[patient] no no numbness\n[doctor] okay alright any loss in sensation\n[patient] no i mean i i can still feel like i can still feel my foot\n[doctor] okay alright that's good to hear so you were playing tennis is that what you normally do to work out\n[patient] i do i'm trying to learn but i can not afford tennis less lessons so me and my friends just hit the balls back and forth i do sleep\n[doctor] i love it absolutely yeah my dad one time took me to play racquet ball and i learned the very bruisy way that that was n't for me yeah\n[patient] that scares me\n[doctor] it's it they they move pretty fast i'm not gon na lie alright so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my my physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my findings but if you have any questions go ahead stop me let me know but i will be explaining along the way okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so i've looked at your vitals and honestly they look great you know your blood pressure i see is one twenty five over seventy that's almost textbook respiratory rate we are seeing you at a smooth eighteen excuse me your temperature you're running normal ninety seven . one you're you're satting at a hundred percent so and then your pulse so that's interesting like you're you're going at like about sixty beats a minute so i think they're i think we're doing pretty well i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your heart on your heart exam i do n't appreciate any like murmur rub or gallop we have a nice regular rate and rhythm for your lung exam i do appreciate a little bit of stridor that's really interesting but i do n't hear any wheezes or rales so that's great for your i know this sounds weird but for your abdominal exam i do n't appreciate any rebound no guarding on your skin exam i do n't sorry like on your your head everything looks symmetrical your your mucosal membranes are normal you do n't feel hot to touch so that's great but i'm gon na do my foot exam okay so on the right foot there is some bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot there is associated swelling when i touch on your midfoot here does it hurt\n[patient] no uh uh\n[doctor] okay alright tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals alright it's also warm to touch alright so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill is appropriate pedal pulses are strong and sensation is intact so i know that before here we before i came in that we got an x-ray so i've reviewed the results of your x-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space alright i know those were a bunch of fancy words so now i'm gon na explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right foot pain consistent with a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot right so the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kinda like bend it right that's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam and what i'm seeing on your x-ray i am gon na recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help prevent further complications there are also many ligaments at the top of your foot so i will be ordering an mri to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments i know this is a lot do you have any questions\n[patient] yeah do i have to do the surgery\n[doctor] so i'm recommending it as there can be significant complications to your foot if you do n't it can lead to poor bone alignment or poor ligament healing which can lead to you losing the arch of your foot and becoming flat-footed you can also develop arthritis in that foot so yes i i i highly recommend it if you want to be able to walk and move about in a way that you are familiar with\n[patient] i just hate that word surgery doc\n[doctor] i know\n[patient] you know it scares me every time i mean especially with my foot i want to be able to walk again and so i just get really worried i mean how long is the procedure usually too\n[doctor] so it's actually\n[patient] have to be in the hospital\n[doctor] no no no no no it's actually a day surgery and you'll be able to go home the same day and then you will follow up with me here in the clinic in about a week you'll be in a cast and you will use crutches as you will not be able to use that foot for six to eight weeks after that you'll start gradually walking on your foot based on how you do so the procedure itself is not very long you will and so like since you will be able to go home that's great but you wo n't be able to drive especially since you're saying are you left handed or right handed\n[patient] i'm right handed\n[doctor] yeah so your your right foot is probably your dominant one and the also the one you're supposed to drive with so no you're gon na you're gon na need somebody to take you home but what\n[patient] i mean\n[doctor] uh uh\n[patient] does that mean i'm out for the rest of the season i mean i wan na be able to get back and play again i really am i'm getting a little better so i\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] i really wan na keep on playing my tennis with my friends but\n[doctor] yeah so unfortunately yes it does mean that you're out for the rest of the season but hopefully we can get you a great get you to a set up well for next season and in the meantime i think i'm gon na recommend after surgery that we get you to physical therapy i think that that's gon na be a really great way to like kinda strengthen the muscles and make sure that you're at peak performance before we put you back out there\n[patient] i suppose so\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] thank you\n[doctor] no problem so i do wan na let you know that there are some risks associated with any kind of surgical procedure i'm gon na bring you some paperwork and that my ma is gon na go over with you such as like risks of bleeding loss of sensation nerve damage all those things will be discussed with you and if you have any questions leading up to and even after your procedure go ahead and ask them and we'll be more than happy to help with that okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] good\n[doctor] thank you\n[patient] thank you",
                  "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nBrittany Edwards is a 76-year-old female, right-hand-dominant, female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right foot pain. The onset of her pain began 2 days ago, when she was playing tennis and was trying to volley the ball when she got in front of another player and fell on the dorsal aspect of her right foot. She states that she quickly twisted her foot because she was trying to catch herself. The patient reports that she was unable to continue playing secondary to the pain. She states that she wrapped her foot after the game and iced it last night. The patient adds that she kept her foot up on a pillow and took ibuprofen for pain. She denies any numbness. The patient denies any loss of sensation.\n\nThe patient has a history of a left leg injury.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain.\nNeurological: Denies numbness in the right foot.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nSKIN: Warm\nNEURO: Normal sensation.\nMSK:\nExamination of the right foot: Bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test of the 1st and 2nd metatarsals. Warm to touch. Neurovascular intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.\nExamination of the left foot: Brisk capillary refill to all digits and light touch intact.\n\nRESULTS\n\n3 views of the right foot were taken. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is the presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight foot pain, consistent with a Lisfranc fracture.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays revealed a Lisfranc fracture. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we proceed with surgical intervention. The plan is to proceed with a right foot ORIF and all indicated procedures. We went over the risk, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. The risk include but not limited to continued pain, swelling, damage to surrounding tissue including nerves and blood vessels, numbness that could be permanent, infection, nonunion, malunion, failure of hardware, and need for further surgery. There is always a risk of amputation, heart attack, stroke, blood clots, pulmonary embolism, and death. There is a possibility of chronic pain and the inability to get back to the previous level of function. The patient wishes to proceed with the operation and she will follow up with me on the day of surgery. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right foot.\n"

                  "[doctor] hey linda good to see you today so looking here in my notes looks like you you think you have a kidney stone think you've had them before and and you i guess you're having some pain and while we are here i see you i see you have a you have past medical history of hypertension diabetes and we will check up on those as well so with your kidney stone can you tell me what happened what's going on\n[patient] and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] started having pain on my left back\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and since then i continued to have pain it is traveling a little lower it's gotten little low but i definitely have not passed it yet and i'm just in so much pain\n[doctor] okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go\n[patient] it's constant\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] all the time i ca n't get comfortable\n[doctor] alright are you able to urinate\n[patient] i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood\n[doctor] okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes\n[patient] i've had it for probably this might be my third time\n[doctor] third time alright\n[patient] yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time\n[doctor] okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever\n[patient] no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous\n[doctor] okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain\n[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working\n[doctor] okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved\n[patient] yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah\n[doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] so we are getting close there\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff\n[patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff\n[doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running\n[patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the\n[doctor] the one eighties which was really high\n[patient] right\n[doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that\n[patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] like\n[doctor] we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help\n[patient] yeah some help could be helpful okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright\n[doctor] so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday\n[patient] i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds\n[doctor] okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday\n[patient] i do\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i do take it\n[doctor] that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain\n[patient] no chest pain\n[doctor] no chest pain are you having any belly pain\n[patient] the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain\n[doctor] no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound\n[patient] that sounds good and i i just i just want this pain to go away so thank you\n[doctor] okay no problem",

                  "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nKidney stones.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMason Ward is a pleasant 80-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of kidney stones. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 1 week ago when he was in his barn moving hay when he had a sudden onset of right back pain. The patient initially thought his pain was due to throwing hay; however, he broke out into a sweat and became nauseated. He was seen by his primary care physician, who ordered a CT scan and told him that he had a kidney stone. He denies having kidney stones before, but states that his father has a history of kidney stones in the past. He explains that when he had pain, which has now resolved, it would radiate almost to his groin. The patient describes the pain as intermittent after he found out it was a kidney stone. He explains that he has been straining his urine, but has not seen anything. He denies any hematuria.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right back pain.\n\nVITALS\n\nVitals look good, blood pressure and hear rate are within normal limits. Temperature is within normal limits.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the abdomen: No pain with palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. There is CVA tenderness on the right side.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe CT scan of the abdomen revealed a stone that is measuring 0.5 cm located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight kidney stone.\n\nPLAN\n\nWe reviewed the patient's CT results in detail today. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have prescribed the patient oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours for pain. He may continue to take Tylenol between the oxycodone doses for any breakthrough pain. The patient should continue to use the strainer when he urinates until the stone passes. I have also recommended that we obtain a BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his symptoms have not improved, we will discuss further treatment options including lithotripsy."
