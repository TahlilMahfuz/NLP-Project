The origins of the arch vessels are patent. Significant atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the common carotid artery bifurcations, extending into the proximal internal carotid artery on both sides. The cervical internal carotid arteries are very tortuous in their course, with the right cervical internal carotid artery, being more superficial just underneath the sternocleidomastoid muscle. There is a short segment of stenosis in the proximal left cervical internal carotid artery, over a length of 1.9 cm, with the narrowest luminal diameter of 2.6 mm corresponding to 45-50% stenosis. No flow limitation is noted distally. In the right proximal cervical internal carotid artery significant atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the bifurcation, causing mild stenosis. These are also noted extending into the proximal cervical internal carotid artery, at its origin causing stenosis with a residual lumen, of 2.1 mm (series 4, image 150), resulting in 56% (55-60%) stenosis. These have not significantly changed since the prior two CT angiograms done on  and , with the measurements, given on the study done on , being slightly underestimated due to technical factors. If more detailed assessment of the stenosis is necessary, this region is amenable to carotid Doppler evaluation and can be considered.

"After the risks and benefits were explained to the patient, written informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table. A preprocedure timeout was obtained to confirm the patient's name, procedure, and the site. The right groin was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. Combining palpatory technique and fluoroscopic guidance, a 19-gauge single-wall arterial puncture needle was used to access the right femoral artery. A 0.035 Bentson guidewire was then placed through the needle under fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was exchanged for a 5-French sheath with inner dilator. After the inner dilator was removed, the sheath was connected with a continueous sidearm flush. A C2 catheter was then placed over the wire. After the wire was removed, the C2 catheter was used to subsequently engage the origin of the superior (SMA) and inferior () mesenteric arteries. Selective superior mesenteric arteriogram, inferior mesenteric arteriogram and superselective arteriogram of several small branches of the SMA were performed. Active bleeding was confirmed at the hepatic flexure, best accessed through a middle colic branch coming off the proximal superior mesenteric artery. Additional selective and superselective angiograms of the SMA and its branches were performed to precise the anatomy and helped determining the origin of the middle colic branch feeding the bleeding area.

Next, air was insufflated into the stomach via the indwelling nasogastric tube under fluoroscopic monitoring. The patient was given 1 mg of glucagon to decrease the rate of peristalsis. Once a safe adequate window for our approach was determined under fluoroscopy, the skin was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine over the proposed puncture site. Next, three T- fasteners were placed using a  safety T-kit. Contrast was injected during each placement to ensure intraluminal position. Next, an introducer needle was placed between the three T-fasteners into the gastric lumen and the needle was exchanged for a 0.035  wire.

Therefore, decision was made to gain access through the left common femoral vein. Under ultrasonographic guidance, access was gained to the left common femoral vein with a 19-gauge needle. A 0.035  guide wire was advanced through the needle into the inferior vena . The needle was removed over the wire and a 5-French sheath was introduced. A 4-French Omni Flush catheter was then advanced over the wire into the inferior vena . Inferior cavogram was obtained. It showed a single inferior vena ,  image suggestive of possible filling defect in the region of the right common iliac vein. The catheter was then advanced up and a new more proximal cavogram was obtained. It showed inflow defects documenting the level of the renal arteries and therefore allowing planning of the adequate site for deployment of the IVC filter. Catheter and sheath were removed over the wire and a 9-French filter deployment sheath was advanced over the wire into the inferior vena . Permanent Vena Tech filter was then advanced through the sheath under fluoroscopic guidance and was precisely deployed below the renal veins. Final abdominal x-ray was obtained documenting position and adequate deployment of the IVC filter. The sheath was removed and pressure was held until hemostasis was achieved.

"Examination is directed toward evaluation of the vascular structures. There is some susceptibility artifact across the stent in the brachiocephalic vein and at its entry point into the SVC. The left subclavian vein is opacified with contrast on the arterial phase image. This is in keeping with the patient who has a known AV fistula in the left arm. While it is difficult to appreciate on the source images due to overlap structures and signal intensity, when oblique axial reformats are performed along the axis of the plane, a thin trickle of contrast is seen through the stent with narrowing in the mid portion of the stent. The subclavian vein distal to the stent and the SVC proximal to the stent are well opacified with contrast. It is favored that this represents a stenosis within the stent.

The origins of the left main and right coronary arteries were identified in their customary positions. The diameters of the ascending, arch, and descending thoracic aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter was also normal. The left atrial AP dimension was normal. The right and left atrial lengths in the 4-chamber view were normal. The coronary sinus diameter was normal. The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension index and the end-diastolic volume index were normal. The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction was mildly depressed at 56% with mild global hypokinesis. The left ventricular mass was normal. The right ventricular end-diastolic volume index was normal. The calculated right ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 54%, with normal right ventricular free wall function. (Over)  5:05 PM MR CARDIAC/FUNCTION, COMPL; MR   FLOW MAP Clip #  Reason: 23yo fm with refractory Hodgkin's and pericardial involvemen ______________________________________________________________________________ FINAL REPORT (Cont) The aortic valve was trileaflet with normal valve area. The pericardial thickness was normal with no evidence of tethering on tagged images. Quantitative Flow Due to significant ventricular ectopy, neither pulmonic flows nor an intra- cardiac shunt could be calculated by flow analysis. A QP/QS of 1.1 was estimated from the left and right ventricular quantitative analysis (assuming no significant mitral or tricuspid regurgitation). The calculated mitral valve regurgitant fraction was consistent with no significant mitral regurgitation.","1. Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild global left hypokinesis.
