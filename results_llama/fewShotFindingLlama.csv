A limited ultrasound examination of the left upper extremity was then performed revealing a thrombosed basilic vein with a patent and compressible brachial vein. The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. The skin and subcutaneous tissues were anesthetized with 5 cc of 1% lidocaine.

A standard 0.018 guide wire was advanced through the access needle into the left subclavian vein but was unable to be passed centrally. At this time, the skin entry site was incised with a #11 blade scalpel. The access needle was exchanged for a 5-French micropuncture sheath with inner dilator. A 0.018 Glidewire was passed through the micropuncture sheath, beyond the area of obstruction, into the right heart. After the inner dilator was removed, an attempt was made to advance the dual-lumen PICC line over the Glidewire into the superior vena cava.

The origins of the arch vessels are patent. Significant atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the common carotid artery bifurcations, extending into the proximal internal carotid artery on both sides. The cervical internal carotid arteries are very tortuous in their course, with the right cervical internal carotid artery, being more superficial just underneath the sternocleidomastoid muscle. There is a short segment of stenosis in the proximal left cervical internal carotid artery, over a length of 1.9 cm, with the narrowest luminal diameter of 2.6 mm corresponding to 45-50% stenosis. No flow limitation is noted distally. In the right proximal cervical internal carotid artery significant atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the bifurcation, causing mild stenosis. These are also noted extending into the proximal cervical internal carotid artery, at its origin causing stenosis with a residual lumen, of 2.1 mm (series 4, image 150), resulting in 56% (55-60%) stenosis. These have not significantly changed since the prior two CT angiograms done on  and , with the measurements, given on the study done on , being slightly underestimated due to technical factors. If more detailed assessment of the stenosis is necessary, this region is amenable to carotid Doppler evaluation and can be considered.

Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the origins of both vertebral arteries, left more than right, as well as a few scattered areas of calcifications along the V2 segment of the left vertebral artery.

"After the risks and benefits were explained to the patient, written informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table. A preprocedure timeout was obtained to confirm the patient's name, procedure, and the site. The right groin was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. Combining palpatory technique and fluoroscopic guidance, a 19-gauge single-wall arterial puncture needle was used to access the right femoral artery. A 0.035 Bentson guidewire was then placed through the needle under fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was exchanged for a 5-French sheath with inner dilator. After the inner dilator was removed, the sheath was connected with a continueous sidearm flush. A C2 catheter was then placed over the wire. After the wire was removed, the C2 catheter was used to subsequently engage the origin of the superior (SMA) and inferior () mesenteric arteries. Selective superior mesenteric arteriogram, inferior mesenteric arteriogram and superselective arteriogram of several small branches of the SMA were performed. Active bleeding was confirmed at the hepatic flexure, best accessed through a middle colic branch coming off the proximal superior mesenteric artery. Additional selective and superselective angiograms of the SMA and its branches were performed to precise the anatomy and helped determining the origin of the middle colic branch feeding the bleeding area.

"Examination is directed toward evaluation of the vascular structures. There is some susceptibility artifact across the stent in the brachiocephalic vein and at its entry point into the SVC. The left subclavian vein is opacified with contrast on the arterial phase image. This is in keeping with the patient who has a known AV fistula in the left arm. While it is difficult to appreciate on the source images due to overlap structures and signal intensity, when oblique axial reformats are performed along the axis of the plane, a thin trickle of contrast is seen through the stent with narrowing in the mid portion of the stent. The subclavian vein distal to the stent and the SVC proximal to the stent are well opacified with contrast. It is favored that this represents a stenosis within the stent.
