"**History** The patient presented with complaints of respiratory pain and reported experiencing dyspnea, especially during exertion or when lying down. The symptoms started a few days ago and have progressively worsened since. The patient described the pain as a sharp, persistent discomfort localized to their chest region, but denied having any cough or fever. There have been no recent travels, exposure to new medications, or known allergens. The patient’s past medical history is significant for mild, well-controlled seasonal allergies, for which they take occasional antihistamines. No history of recent infections or significant contact with anyone who has been acutely ill. **Physical Examination** On examination, the patient appeared moderately distressed due to difficulty breathing. Vital signs were within normal limits, except for mild tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. The lung examination revealed decreased breath sounds and mild expiratory wheezes bilaterally. Palpation of the chest wall did not provoke pain, reducing the likelihood of musculoskeletal etiology. Heart sounds were normal, without any murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Oxygen saturation was recorded at 93% on room air.
