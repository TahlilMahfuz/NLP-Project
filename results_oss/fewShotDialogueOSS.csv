HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Brian White is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure and hypertension, who presents today for follow-up of his chronic problems. The patient states he has been feeling out of sorts lately. He is not sure if it is due to the change in the seasons or due to performing lots of projects and some construction on his home. He reports fatigue and lightheadedness. This has been going on for about 5 weeks. While exerting energy, he has experienced some shortness of breath and chest cramps. The patient also notes a slight cough, but he is not sure if it is just the change in seasons. He feels bloated every once in a while. His diet has been a little bit of a struggle. They had construction on their kitchen begin over Labor Day weekend, and have been eating less healthy food as a result. Regarding his heart failure, he has been pretty good with his salt intake. He has been pretty good about his diet since the last year and is staying on top of that as much as possible. The patient has continued to utilize Lasix daily. For his hypertension, this has been well controlled with lisinopril 20 mg a day. He has continued to monitor his blood pressure regularly. The patient did the review of systems sheet when he checked in. He denies weight gain, swelling in the lower extremities, fevers, chills, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS • Constitutional: Endorses fatigue. Denies fevers, chills, or weight loss. • Cardiovascular: Endorses chest pain or dyspnea on exertion. • Respiratory: Endorses cough and shortness of breath. • Gastrointestinal: Endorses bloating. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION • Neck: JVD 8 cm. • Respiratory: Rales bilateral bases. • Cardiovascular: 3/6 systolic ejection murmur. • Musculoskeletal: 1+ pitting edema bilateral lower extremities. RESULTS X-ray of the chest demonstrates a mild amount of fluid in the lungs. Echocardiogram demonstrates decreased ejection fraction of 45% and mild mitral regurgitation. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN Brian White is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure and hypertension, who presents today for follow up of his chronic problems. Congestive heart failure. • Medical Reasoning: The patient reports increased fatigue, dizziness, and chest discomfort on exertion. He also exhibits some jugular venous distention, lung base crackles, and lower extremity edema on exam today. He has been compliant with his current medications but admits to dietary indiscretion lately. His recent echocardiogram demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 45%, as well as mitral regurgitation. • Additional Testing: We will order a repeat echocardiogram. • Medical Treatment: Increase Lasix to 80 mg daily. • Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to monitor and record his daily weight and report those to me via the patient portal. He will contact me should he continue to experience any dyspnea. Hypertension. • Medical Reasoning: This is well controlled based on home monitoring. • Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily. • Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to monitor and record his blood pressures at home and report these to me via the patient portal. Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","**Assessment & Plan – Brian M., 58 y/o male**

HPI: Ms. Thompson is a 43-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of right knee pain. She states she was trying to change a lightbulb on a ladder, and she twisted her knee when she stumbled and caught herself from falling yesterday. She has been applying ice and taking Ibuprofen without relief. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Ibuprofen, digoxin. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Atrial fibrillation. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Rhinoplasty. EXAM Examination of the right knee shows pain with flexion. Tenderness over the medial joint line. No pain in the calf. Pain with valgus stress. Sensation is intact. RESULTS X-rays of the right knee show no obvious signs of acute fracture or dislocation. Mild effusion is noted. IMPRESSION Right knee acute medial meniscus sprain. PLAN At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended a knee brace. She will take Motrin 800 mg, every 6 hours with food, for two weeks. She will use crutches for the next couple of days. She will follow up with me in 1 week for a repeat evaluation. If she is not better at that time, we will obtain an MRI. All questions were answered.","**Assessment**  
- **CC:** Right knee pain after a fall/ twist on a ladder (yesterday).  
- **Hx:** 43‑year‑old female, atrial fibrillation on digoxin. No other injuries.  
- **Exam:** Localized tenderness over the medial joint line (medial meniscus region), pain with valgus stress and knee flexion. Normal sensation, no calf tenderness.  
- **Imaging:** Plain X‑ray of the right knee shows normal bony alignment, no fracture or dislocation; mild joint effusion present.  
- **Impression:** Acute medial meniscus strain/sprain (medial meniscus injury) without fracture.

**Plan**  
1. **Conservative management**  
   - **Knee brace** (medial support) to limit valgus stress.  
   - **Crutches** for ambulation for the next 2–3 days, weight‑bearing as tolerated.  
   - **Ice** 15–20 min every 2‑3 h while awake.  
   - **NSAID:** Ibuprofen (Motrin) 800 mg PO every 6 h with food, 2‑week supply.  
   - **Rest** and avoid activities that provoke pain (e.g., ladder work, deep knee bending).  

2. **Medication review**  
   - Continue **digoxin** as prescribed for atrial fibrillation; no change needed.  

3. **Follow‑up**  
   - Return visit in **7 days** for reassessment of pain, swelling, and range of motion.  
   - If symptoms persist or worsen, obtain an **MRI** of the knee to evaluate for meniscal tear or other intra‑articular pathology.  

4. **Patient education**  
   - Discuss proper use of brace and crutches, importance of medication timing, and signs that warrant earlier evaluation (increasing swelling, locking, inability to bear weight).  

The patient verbalized understanding and agreement with the plan."

 yes , i am .  okay . and then lastly , i know that you had had some early arthritis in your knee . how- how are you doing with that ?  uh ... it gets aggravated every once in a while . if i- maybe if i run too much or if i've lift boxes that are a little too heavy , i start to feel the strain . but it's been okay . not great , but it's been okay .  okay . all right , well ... let me go ahead and- you know , i know that the nurse did a review of systems sheet with you when you- when you checked in . i know that you were endorsing the back pain .  have you had any other symptoms , chest pain , nausea or vomiting-  no .  . fever , chills ?

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Mr. Logan Walker is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history significant for diabetes type 2, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who presents today with back pain. Mr. Walker reports that he was helping his daughter move some heavy equipment and lifted some heavy boxes a little too quickly on Saturday. He thought he heard a pop when he moved and he had to lie down for about an hour before his pain resolved. He has had stiffness ever since. The pain is located in his lower back. He took Tylenol, ibuprofen, and used Icy Hot on the area, but it did not seem to help. The patient endorses some tingling in his toes on his right foot, which resolved Sunday afternoon. He finds it difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep at night, and he tends to lie on his right side, which seems to help a little bit. Regarding his diabetes type 2, Mr. Walker reports that he has not cooked a meal at home in weeks, due to travel. He notes that his diet has not been great, and he thinks he needs to eat clean for a couple of weeks. He monitors his blood pressure at home and it is under control for the most part. Regarding his osteoarthritis, Mr. Walker reports occasional aggravation of his knee when he runs too much or lifts boxes that are too heavy. The patient denies chest pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers, and chills. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS • Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills. • Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain. • Musculoskeletal: Endorses back pain and stiffness. Endorses knee pain with exertion. • Neurological: Endorsed tingling in toes until Sunday, denies tingling today. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION • Cardiovascular: Slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. • Musculoskeletal: Pain to palpation of the lumbar spine. Pain with flexion and extension of the back. Negative straight leg raise. VITALS REVIEWED • Blood Pressure: Elevated RESULTS Hemoglobin A1c is elevated at 8. X-ray of the back is unremarkable. Normal bony alignment. No fracture present. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN Mr. Logan Walker is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history significant for diabetes type 2, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who presents today with low back pain. Lumbar strain. • Medical Reasoning: He injured his lower back while moving heavy boxes. His recent x-ray was unremarkable. • Medical Treatment: Initiate meloxicam 15 mg once a day. • Specialist Referrals: Referral to physical therapy. • Patient Education and Counseling: He was encouraged to continue icing the area and avoid strenuous activity. Diabetes type 2. • Medical Reasoning: His recent hemoglobin A1c was elevated at 8. He does admit to some dietary indiscretion lately. • Additional Testing: Repeat hemoglobin A1c in 6 months. • Medical Treatment: Increase metformin to 1000 mg twice a day. Hypertension. • Medical Reasoning: His blood pressures have been slightly elevated based on home monitoring and in clinic today. • Medical Treatment: Increase lisinopril from 10 mg to 20 mg a day. Osteoarthritis. • Medical Reasoning: This is mostly well controlled. • Medical Treatment: Continue to monitor the knee. No further work up is needed at this time. Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","**Assessment & Plan**

| # | Diagnosis | Assessment (key points) | Plan |
|---|-----------|--------------------------|------|
| 1 | **Acute lumbar strain / muscular sprain** (left paraspinal tenderness, negative straight‑leg raise, normal neuro, no red‑flag features) | Likely a soft‑tissue injury from lifting. No acute fracture on X‑ray; MRI not required now but will be obtained if pain does not improve in 2 weeks. | • Start **naproxen 500 mg PO BID** for inflammation.<br>• Add **cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) 10 mg PO BID** for muscle spasm.<br>• Refer to **physical therapy** for lumbar strengthening and posture training.<br>• Advise activity modification, heat/ice as needed, and avoid heavy lifting. |
| 2 | **Type 2 diabetes mellitus** – A1c 7.1 % (last checked), fasting glucose 120‑140 mg/dL, on metformin 500 mg BID | Glycemic control acceptable but can be optimized. | • Continue **metformin 500 mg BID**.<br>• Order a **repeat hemoglobin A1c** today.<br>• Reinforce diet/exercise counseling (reduce simple carbs, limit sweets). |
| 3 | **Hypertension** – clinic BP ≈ 120/70 mm Hg, but **1+ non‑pitting ankle edema** likely secondary to amlodipine (Norvasc) | Blood pressure controlled; edema suggests calcium‑channel blocker‑related fluid retention. | • **Discontinue amlodipine**.<br>• Start **hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg PO daily**.<br>• Obtain **CBC, BMP (including renal function)**, **EKG**, and **chest X‑ray** to assess for any other causes of edema.<br>• Instruct patient to monitor home BP and report any recurrence of edema. |
| 4 | **Hyperlipidemia** – high cholesterol on record, no current symptoms | No change in therapy mentioned; continue current regimen and lifestyle measures. | • Continue current lipid‑lowering medication (if any).<br>• Emphasize diet low in saturated fat and regular exercise. |
| 5 | **General health maintenance** | No red‑flag neurologic or vascular findings; stable overall. | • Follow‑up in **2 weeks** (or sooner if edema worsens or back pain does not improve).<br>• Review lab results, BP log, and response to pain regimen.<br>• Provide education on medication adherence, proper dosing (all meds can be taken together with food), and when to seek urgent care (e.g., new weakness, numbness, urinary retention). |

is it running high , or ...  i ... i'm pretty regular with the medications during the business week , but on there's weekends , you know , if i'm on the fly or doing something , sometimes i forget , or i forget to bring it with me . uh , but for the most part , it's been okay .  okay . all right . um , and then i know that you've had that prior lobectomy a couple years ago . any issues with shortness of breath with all the allergies or anything ?  other than during the heat and the pollen , it's been pretty good .  okay . all right . so i , i know that the nurse went over the review of systems sheet with you , and , and you endorsed some nasal congestion from the pollen , but how about any shortness of breath , cough , muscle aches ?  sometimes i , i regularly , uh , go for a run in the morning . that's my workout , and sometimes if it's , uh , relatively humid , i'll struggle a little bit , and i might feel a little bit of pounding in my chest . it usually goes away , but , uh , again , for the most part , it's been pretty good .  okay , so you also have some shortness of breath with with exertion .  correct . correct .  all right , and how far are you running ?  uh , like 4 to 5 miles a day .  okay , great . all right . well , let's go ahead . i'd like to do a quick physical exam . let's look at your blood pressure .  mm-hmm .  hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . so here in the office today , your blood pressure looks quite well , at 120 over 80 . let's look at your prior trends . hey , dragon , show me the blood pressure readings . so , yeah , it looks , it looks good . i think you're doing a good job . it looks lower than it has in the past , so continue on the current medication .  mm-hmm .  all right , so i'm just gon na listen to your heart and lungs and check you out , okay ?

hey , dragon , show me the ekg . so they did an ekg before you came in today .  mm-hmm .  and in reviewing the results , it looks like your ekg is completely normal , so that's good .  good .  so i'm not too concerned about that , that chest pounding . hey , dragon , show me the chest x-ray . and we also did a chest x-ray , which , which looks really good , uh , and you know , your prior lobectomy , there's no ... everything looks good , okay ? it looks normal . so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you . so for your first problem , your , your depression , it seems , again , like you're doing really well-  mm-hmm .  . with your current strategy . let's continue you on the prozac 20 milligrams a day and do you need a refill on that ?  uh , actually , i do need a refill .  okay . hey , dragon , order a refill of prozac , 20 milligrams daily . from a ... for your next problem , the lobectomy , i think , you know , i do n't think we need to do any more workup of that . it seems like you're exercising a lot . your breathing function is fine . so , uh , i , i do n't think you need to follow up with the surgeon anymore . and then for your last problem , your hypertension .  mm-hmm .  you're doing a great job of keeping it controlled . i know you said you have n't been taking it that much on the weekends , but your blood pressure here looks good , and it's much better over the last several years . so let's go ahead . i do wan na order just , um , an echocardiogram for that murmur . hey , dragon , order an echocardiogram . and i'll just follow up with the results , and we'll go ahead and order , um , your routine blood work , and i'll be in touch with you through the patient portal , okay ?  perfect .  all right . good to see you .  same here .  hey , dragon , finalize the note . the nurse will be in .  thank you .","CHIEF COMPLAINT Annual exam. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression and prior lobectomy, as well as hypertension. He presents for his annual exam. The patient reports that he is doing relatively well. Over the summer, he moved his oldest daughter into college which was a little stressful and chaotic in the heat of the summer. Regarding his depression, he reports that he has been consistent with his Prozac and has not had any incidents in a while. His hypertension has been slightly uncontrolled. He reports that he is taking his blood pressure at home and it is running high. The patient states that he is pretty regular with his Norvasc during the business week, but on the weekends he will forget to bring it with him. He reports that he had a prior lobectomy a couple of years ago. He endorses shortness of breath with exertion. The patient has difficulty breathing due to allergies and the heat in the summertime. He also endorses some nasal congestion from the pollen. He reports that he runs in the morning. Occasionally, if it is relatively humid, he will struggle a little bit with breathing and he will feel a little bit of a pounding in his chest. He states that it usually goes away. He reports that he runs 4 to 5 miles a day. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS • Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses nasal congestion from the pollen. • Cardiovascular: Endorses intermittent palpitations. Endorses dyspnea on exertion. • Respiratory: Endorses shortness of breath. Endorses cough. • Psychiatric: Endorses depression. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION • Head and Face: Pain to palpation to the sinuses. • Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. • Cardiovascular: Regular rate. 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. No gallops or rubs. No extra heart sounds. VITALS REVIEWED • Blood Pressure: 124/80 mmHg. RESULTS Electrocardiogram stable. X-ray of the chest is unremarkable. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN Ralph Barnes is a 62-year-old male who presents for his annual examination. Annual visit. • Additional Testing: I have ordered his routine blood work and will follow up with the patient via the portal once results are back. Depression. • Medical Reasoning: He is doing well with his current regimen. • Medical Treatment: He can continue Prozac 20 mg a day and I provided a refill of that today. History of lobectomy. • Medical Reasoning: I do not think we need to do any more work up for this issue. He is able to exercise a lot and his breathing function is back. I do not think he needs to follow up with the surgeon anymore. Hypertension. • Medical Reasoning: He is doing well on his current regimen. His blood pressure was normal today and has been trending well over the past several years. • Additional Testing: I ordered an echocardiogram to evaluate his murmur. • Medical Treatment: He can continue Norvasc. Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","**Assessment & Plan**

"today i'm seeing christina cooper . her date of birth is 07/01/1954 . uh , ms. cooper is a new patient who was referred by diane nelson for a long-standing iron deficiency anemia .  hello , how are you ?  i'm good , thank you .  so tell me what brings you in today .  recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic .  or how have you been feeling in general with this ?  not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me .  okay . are there any other symptoms ?  i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess .  sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ?  yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old .  right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ?  well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly .  yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ?  about five to six years ago .  and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ?  no . they said they'd see me in 10 years .  well that's good news .  yeah , i agree .  um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ?  no .  all right . do you ever drink alcohol ?  yeah , but only once or twice a year .  okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ?  i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year .  all right . and what are you taking ?  i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily .  okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ?  yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening .  okay . anything else ?  yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff .  okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on .  sounds good . thank you .  of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented .  okay .  all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs .  okay .  all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen .  okay .  is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ?  no .  okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding .  is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ?  actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why .  lovely .  yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system .  okay .  we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better .  all right .  so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled .  okay .  um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ?  no , i was just sleepy afterwards .  okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy .  okay . sounds like a plan .  all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work .  okay , that sounds great .  all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you .  thank you .  you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper .  you too .  all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .","CHIEF COMPLAINT Iron deficiency anemia. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Mrs. Christina Cooper is a 65-year-old female who presents with a long-history of iron deficiency anemia. The patient reports she has been living with anemia since she was 13 years old. She attempted to donate blood on 12/2019 but was unable to due to her anemia. She has a history of heavy menstruation and a hysterectomy in 1996. She completed a colonoscopy 5-6 years ago with nonsignificant findings. She denies having a pacemaker, defibrillator, sleep apnea, or using oxygen. Mrs. Cooper reports a myriad of symptoms, stating she feels fatigued often during the day, feverish with chills at times, and during activity feels she cannot catch her breath and some wheezing is present. She has been having some headaches which is uncommon for her. Additionally, she is noticing tingling sensations, cold sensitivity, and her anxiety and depression have worsened. PAST HISTORY Surgical Hysterectomy, 1996. Procedures Colonoscopy 5-6 years ago. SOCIAL HISTORY Drink’s alcohol 1-2 times per year. CURRENT MEDICATIONS Ferrous Sulfate 25 mg tablet twice per day (1 in the morning, 1 in the evening), Vitamin B12 OTC. PHYSICAL EXAM Gastrointestinal Abdomen non-tender. ASSESSMENT • Iron deficiency anemia Mrs. Cooper is a 65-year-old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12/2019 and was unable to donate blood. Her follow-up blood work in 01/2020 revealed a low hemoglobin, stable hematocrit, and normal iron labs, although, ferritin was low. She has been taking ferrous sulfate 325 mg by mouth. PLAN I have asked her to continue each ferrous sulfate dose with vitamin C found in orange juice for the next 12 weeks then recheck CBC, iron ferritin, B-12, and folate. A referral was sent for her to see a hematologist. We will plan for EGD and colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or GI bleed. If this is inconclusive, capsule endoscopy can be considered. INSTRUCTIONS Schedule upper endoscopy, colonoscopy and appointment with hematologist. Return to the clinic if symptoms worsen.","**Assessment**  
1. **Chronic iron‑deficiency anemia** – lifelong (since age 13), now symptomatic (fatigue, dyspnea, chills, headaches, cold intolerance). Prior work‑up (colonoscopy 5‑6 yr ago) was normal; no obvious source of blood loss identified. Current labs show low hemoglobin with low ferritin despite oral ferrous sulfate.  
2. **Secondary anxiety/depression** – appears to have worsened concurrently with anemia‑related symptoms.  
3. **Routine health maintenance** – age‑appropriate cancer screening up to date (colonoscopy due in ~4 yr, recent hysterectomy eliminates menstrual blood loss).  

**Plan**  
- **GI evaluation**:  
  - Schedule **upper endoscopy (EGD)** and **repeat colonoscopy** to look for occult GI bleeding.  
  - If both are negative, consider **capsule endoscopy** for small‑bowel assessment.  
- **Hematology referral**: Send referral to **Dr. Flores (Hematology)** for further work‑up and discussion of possible IV iron or agents to improve iron utilization.  
- **Iron therapy optimization**:  
  - Continue **ferrous sulfate** 25 mg PO BID **with 8‑oz orange juice (or other vitamin C source) each dose** to enhance absorption for **8‑12 weeks**.  
  - Re‑check CBC, serum iron, ferritin, vitamin B12 and folate after therapy course.  
- **Symptom management**:  
  - Educate patient on iron‑rich diet (red meat, leafy greens) and avoidance of tea/coffee with iron doses.  
  - Encourage continued use of B12 supplement.  
- **Psychiatric support**:  
  - Reinforce ongoing therapy for anxiety/depression; consider adjusting treatment if symptoms persist after anemia correction.  
- **Follow‑up**:  
  - Return visit in **4‑6 weeks** to review GI work‑up results and interim labs.  
  - Earlier contact if worsening fatigue, new GI bleeding, or adverse effects from iron therapy.

"patient , bruce ward . date of birth 5/21/1969 . please use my neuro consult template . this is a 52-year-old male with dia- newly diagnosed pituitary lesion . the patient is seen in consultation at the request of dr. henry howard for possible surgical intervention . mr . ward presented to his primary care provider , dr. howard , on 3/1/21 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months . he denied any trouble with headaches in the past . his past clinical history is unremarkable .  worked out for worsening headaches was initiated with brain mri and serology where pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered . i personally reviewed the labs dated 3/3/21 including cbc , unes , uh , coagulation , and crp . all were normal . pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low tsh , all other results were normal . um , i personally reviewed pertinent radiology studies including mri for the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 . the mri reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm . the ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are lo- are noted .  hello , mr . ward . nice to meet you . i'm dr. flores .  hi , doc . nice to meet you .  i was just reviewing your records from dr. howard and he's referred you because the workup for headaches revealed a mass on your pituitary gland . i did review your mri images and you have a significant mass there . can you tell me about the issues you've been experiencing ?  yeah sure . so i'm really getting fed up with these headaches . i've been trying my best to deal with them but they've been going on for months now and i'm really struggling .  where are the headaches located and how would you describe that pain ?  located behind my eyes . it's like a dull nagging ache .  okay . was the onset gradual or sudden ?  well it started about three months ago . and they've been getting worse over time . at first it was like three out of 10 severity , and it just gradually worsened . and now it's about six out of 10 severity . the headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and it feels like a dull ache behind the eyes . they last a few hours at a time , nothing makes them better or worse .  okay . can you tell me if the pain radiates , or if you have any other symptoms ? specifically feeling sick , fever , rashes , neck stiffness , numbness , weakness , passing out ?  no . i have n't been sick or felt sick . ca n't recall a fever or any kind of rash . no- no neck issues , no numbness , no tingling . and i've never passed out in my life . but , um , for some reason recently i seem to be bumping into door frames .  okay . have you noticed any change in your vision or with your balance ?  no i do n't think so . my eyes were checked in the fall .  okay . let's see , do you have any other medical problems that you take medicine for ?  no i do n't have any medical problems and i do n't take any medicines . i tried tylenol a few times for the headaches but it did n't work , so i stopped .  i see . anyone in your family have any history of diseases ?  i was adopted so i really have no idea .  okay . um , what kind of work do you do ? and are you married ?  i work as a computer programmer and i've been married for 25 years . we just bought a small house .  that's nice . um , do you drink any alcohol , smoke , or use recreational drugs ?  nope . i do n't do any of those and never have .  okay . um , well let me take a good look at you . um , now you'll hear me calling out some details as i perform the examination . these will be noted for me in your record and i'll be happy to answer any questions you have once we're done .  sounds good , doc .  all right . the patient is alert , oriented to time , place , and person . affect is appropriate and speech is fluent . cranial nerve examination is grossly intact . no focal , motor , or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities . visual acuity and eye movements are normal . pupils are equal and reactive . visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia . and color vision is normal .  all right , mr. ward . i'm going to review these pictures from the mri with you . um , now this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma , but there's no way to be sure without sending the removed adenoma to pathology to make the diagnosis , which we will do . um , here you can see it's a well defined mass . and it's pressing right here on what we call the optic chiasm . and today when i was having you look at my fingers , you could n't see them off to the sides , that's what we call bitemporal hemianopia . and explains why you have been bumping into door frames .  yeah i never noticed that i could n't see out of the side until you did that test , and you closed one eye with both eyes . i really could n't tell .  no because you're having this vision loss from the mass compressing the optic chiasm , the only option we have is to do surgery .  okay , i understand . do you think i'll regain my vision ?  well there's no guarantees , but it is a possibility . i'm gon na refer you to the eye doctor for a full exam and they'll do what's called visual field test . this will map our your peripheral vision or side vision prior to surgery . and we can monitor after surgery to see if your vision is improving .  all right .  and let's discuss the surgery a little more . um , we would do what's called a transsphenoidal approach to do the surgery . this is minimally invasive and we go through the sphenoid sinus . there are some risks i have to inform you of . uh , risk of anesthesia including but not limited to the risk of heart attack , stroke , and death . risk of surgery include infection , need for further surgery , wound issues such as spinal fluid leak or infection , uh , which may require long , prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure . uh , seizure , stroke , permanent numbness , weakness , difficulty speaking , or even death .  well i guess we have to do it regardless .  okay . so i will have you see our surgery scheduler , deborah , on the way out to get you set up . we will get this scheduled fairly quickly so i do n't want you to be alarmed . um , she'll also get you set up today or tomorrow to have the visual field test and you may not be able to see the eye doctor until after surgery . but we have the pre-surgery visual field test for comparison after surgery .  okay . i look forward to these headaches going away . i never thought it could be something like this going on .  yeah . come this way , we'll get your things lined up . please call if you think of any questions .  thanks , doctor .  diagnosis will be pituitary adenoma . mr . ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has benign appearing pituitary adenoma , incidentally discovered during workup for worsening headaches . he is symptomatic with clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression , therefor surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated . end of note .","CHIEF COMPLAINT Pituitary lesion. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Bruce Ward is a 52-year-old male with a pituitary lesion. The patient is seen in consultation at the request of Dr. Henry Howard for possible surgical intervention. The patient presented to his primary care provider, Dr. Howard, on 03/01/2021 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months. He denied any trouble with headaches in the past. Further work up of headaches with MRI of the brain revealed the pituitary lesion. Mr. Ward reports headaches started about 3 months ago, at which point they were around 3 out of 10 in severity. They have gradually worsened over time and now he rates them at about 6/10. The headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and feel like a dull ache behind the eyes. They tend to last a few hours at a time, and nothing makes them particularly worse or better. Tylenol failed to improve headaches. The patient endorses that recently he has been bumping into door frames, but no obvious problems with his balance or vision. He denies any recent sickness or feeling sick and negative for fever, rash, paresthesia, weakness, neck stiffness, or syncope. PAST HISTORY Medical Newly diagnosed pituitary lesion. FAMILY HISTORY No known family history; adopted. SOCIAL HISTORY Employment Status: Works as a computer programmer. Marital Status: Married for 25 years. Living Arrangement: Lives with wife, recently purchased a new house. Alcohol Use: None. Tobacco Use: Non-smoker. Recreational Drugs: None. PHYSICAL EXAM Neurological Patient alert, oriented to person, place, and time, affect appropriate and speech fluent. Cranial nerve examination grossly intact. No focal motor or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities. Eyes Visual acuity and eye movements are normal. Pupils are equal and reactive. Visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia. Color vision is normal. RESULTS Labs reviewed, 03/03/2021: CBC, U&Es, coagulation, and CRP are all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, all other results were normal. Independent review and interpretation of MRI brain, 03/04/2021: The MRI reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are noted. ASSESSMENT • Pituitary adenoma • Bitemporal hemianopia Mr. Ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has a benign appearing pituitary adenoma discovered on work up for worsening headaches. There is clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression, examination today revealed a bitemporal hemianopia. Radiographically this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma but that there was no way to be sure without a pathological diagnosis. Surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated given optic chiasmal compression. PLAN Pituitary adenoma. We discussed the general indications for surgical intervention. The risks, benefits to trans-sphenoidal resection were explained to the patient. The risks of anesthesia including but not limited to the risks of heart attack, stroke, and death. The risks of surgery including infection, need for further surgery, wound issues (such as spinal fluid leak or infection) which may require prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure, seizure, stroke, permanent numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, or death. The patient voiced understanding and wishes to proceed with trans-sphenoidal resection of the adenoma. Bitemporal hemianopia. We will have the patient scheduled this week to have visual field testing with ophthalmology. The preoperative visual field will serve as baseline for comparison of postoperative visual field testing to monitor for improvement in the bitemporal hemianopia. Additionally, we discussed that unfortunately no guarantees could be given that his vision would return. INSTRUCTIONS • Refer to ophthalmology for baseline visual field testing. • Schedule trans-sphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma.","**Patient: Bruce Ward – 52 y/o male**  
**Reason for consult:** Incidentally discovered pituitary lesion; progressive headaches; bitemporal hemianopia on exam.  

**Assessment**  
- **Pituitary macroadenoma** with optic chiasm compression (MRI shows well‑defined lesion, bitemporal hemianopia, visual field loss).  
- **Symptoms:** Daily dull, retro‑orbital headaches (3 months, worsening, worse in mornings). No nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or focal neurologic deficits.  
- **Endocrine labs:** Low TSH; all other pituitary hormones within normal limits. CBC, metabolic panel, CRP, coagulation studies normal.  

**Plan**  
1. **Surgical management** – Trans‑sphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma (goal: decompression of optic chiasm, headache relief, tumor control).  
   - Schedule pre‑operative visual field testing (formal perimetry) and ophthalmology consult.  
   - Discuss risks (CSF leak, infection, endocrine dysfunction, neurovascular complications) and obtain informed consent.  
2. **Endocrine follow‑up** – Post‑op pituitary hormone panel (TSH, cortisol, prolactin, LH/FSH, IGF‑1) within 24 h of surgery; replace hormones as needed.  
3. **Imaging** – Repeat MRI with contrast 3 months post‑op to assess for residual tumor.  
4. **Medication** – Continue current medications (none reported). Hold anticoagulants if any prior to surgery per standard protocol.  
5. **Patient education** – Reviewed signs of postoperative complications (headache, visual change, CSF leak, endocrine symptoms). Instruct to seek urgent care if any occur.  
6. **Follow‑up** – Surgery scheduler will arrange operative date; postoperative clinic visit in 2 weeks; ophthalmology follow‑up after visual field baseline and again post‑op.

**Patient: Paul Edwards – 59 y/o male**  
**Reason for visit:** Ongoing testosterone replacement for hypogonadism (HIV‑positive); concerns about gynecomastia, lipid profile, and possible dose increase.  

**Assessment**  
- **Hypogonadism on testosterone therapy** – Current regimen: Testosterone cypionate 140 mg IM every 10 days; recent level >1500 ng/dL (likely peak from recent injection).  
- **Metabolic profile** – Triglycerides improved from 265 → 145 mg/dL; total cholesterol modestly reduced. PSA stable at 0.6 ng/mL.  
- **Gynecomastia** – No current comment on breast exam; patient concerned.  
- **Adjunct meds** – Finasteride 2.5 mg daily (half 5 mg tablet); Cialis 5 mg on exercise days, 2.5 mg on non‑exercise days.  
- **Risk considerations** – High testosterone peaks increase risk of polycythemia, thrombotic events, and prostate issues; estradiol currently normal.  

**Plan**  
1. **Maintain current testosterone dose** – Do not increase to 175 mg; counsel on risks of supraphysiologic levels and need for interval monitoring.  
2. **Laboratory monitoring** –  
   - Repeat total testosterone in 4 weeks (trough level, ideally 400‑600 ng/dL).  
   - Repeat estradiol, hemoglobin/hematocrit, CBC, CMP, lipid panel annually (or sooner if symptoms).  
   - PSA annually (already stable).  
3. **Gynecomastia** – Physical exam at next visit; if persistent, consider endocrine evaluation (adjust finasteride, evaluate estrogen).  
4. **Medication refills** – Provide paper prescriptions for finasteride and Cialis; advise pharmacy to fill with 30‑day supply.  
5. **Lifestyle** – Continue med‑calendar adherence; encourage regular exercise and balanced diet; stress importance of hydration and avoiding over‑use of testosterone.  
6. **Follow‑up** – Return in 3 months for labs and symptom review; earlier if new symptoms (e.g., headache, visual changes, breast tenderness, polycythemia symptoms).

---

**Patient: Carolyn [Last name not provided] – 34 y/o female**  
**Reason for visit:** New-onset tension‑type headache; type 2 diabetes mellitus (poor recent control).  

**Assessment**  
- **Tension‑type headache** – Dull posterior head pain, worse evenings, associated with cervical paraspinal and trapezius muscle tenderness; exacerbated by occupational computer work and stress. No red‑flag features (no fever, papilledema, visual changes, sudden onset).  
- **Type 2 diabetes mellitus** – On metformin 500 mg BID; recent self‑reported poor diet and reduced exercise; patient not checking capillary glucose regularly.  
- **Cardiovascular exam** – Grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur unchanged; no acute concerns.  

**Plan**  
1. **Headache management** –  
   - Continue acetaminophen PRN for pain.  
   - Initiate cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) 5 mg PO TID for 2 weeks; reassess.  
   - Recommend ergonomics: frequent breaks, neck stretches, adjustable workstation, stress‑reduction techniques (mindfulness, scheduled relaxation).  
   - Advise to seek care sooner if headaches become severe, new focal neurologic signs, fever, or visual changes.  
2. **Diabetes management** –  
   - Continue metformin 500 mg BID.  
   - Order HbA1c, CBC, CMP now; review results at next visit.  
   - Reinforce daily self‑monitoring of blood glucose; provide log sheet.  
   - Encourage regular aerobic activity (≥150 min/week) and balanced diet; refer to diabetes education if needed.  
3. **Follow‑up** – Return in 4 weeks for headache reassessment and review of labs; earlier if symptoms worsen.  
4. **Patient education** – Reviewed tension‑type headache pathophysiology, medication side‑effects, and importance of glycemic control to reduce headache triggers.

 good morning . yes . that's me .  hey , i'm dr. sanders . it's nice to meet you .  nice to meet you too .  so tell me about what brings you in today ?  well , i really needed to see you three months ... three months ago , but this was your first available appointment . when i called to make the appointment , i was having chest pains , but it stopped after four days , and i have n't had any since then .  okay . when did these four days of chest pain occur ?  um , early october .  of 2020 , correct ?  yes .  okay . can you think of anything that might have caused the chest pain ? did you wake up with it ?  no . it just it randomly . i tolerated it for four days but then had to go to the emergency room because nothing i did relieved it . they did a bunch of testing and did n't find anything .  okay . can you point to the area of your chest where the pain was located ?  well , it was here in the center of my chest , right behind my breastbone . it felt like i was having a heart attack . the pain was really sharp .  did they prescribe you any medications in the er ?  no . they ran an ekg and did blood tests , but like i said , everything was normal .  okay . i see .  they thought it was something to do with the gi system , so that's why they referred me here .  interesting . uh , do you remember having any heartburn or indigestion at , at the time ?  uh , maybe . i do n't think i've ever had heartburn , so i'm not sure what that feels like .  was the pain worse with eating or exercise ?  yes . with eating .  okay . any difficulty swallowing ?  mm-hmm . i did .  okay . and that's also resolved since the initial episode three months ago ?  yes . thankfully . the chest pain and swallowing problem got better about three days after i went to the er . but i just feel like there's something wrong .  okay . so how has your weight been .  i've been trying to lose weight .  that's good . any in- ... issues with abdominal pain ?  uh , no .  okay . good . and how about your bowel movements ; are they okay ?  they're normal .  all right . are you aware of any family history of gi problems ?  i do n't think so .  have had you had any surgeries on your abdomen , or gall bladder , or appendix ?  yes . they took my gall bladder out several years ago .  okay . if you wan na lay down here on the table for me and lets take a look at you .  okay .  so when i push on your lower belly , do you have any pain , or does it feel tender ?  no .  okay . how about up here in your upper abdomen ?  yes . it , it hurts a little .  okay . and even when i press lightly like this ?  yes . uh , just a little uncomfortable .  okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ? or is it about the same ?  i'd say it's about the same .  okay . so we'll say you have some mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants , but everything on your exam looks normal and looks good .  okay . good .  so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously , with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues , but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er . um , other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus . but typically with these , um ... but typically , these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had . um , it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days .  well , since you mention anxiety , i was going through a really stressful job transition right around the time this happened .  okay . that's good to know . so stress from this could be , um ... could be , uh ... could be very well have contributed to your condition .  okay .  so we could do an , uh , egd or upper endoscopy to take a look at your esophagus and stomach . this would allow us to look for esophagitis . but your symptoms occurred three months ago and you have n't had any additional episodes , so likely if it were esophagitis , it's already healed by the point ... by this point , and we would n't be able to see anything . the other option is just to continue to monitor , uh , for any additional symptoms at which point we could do the egd . uh , with you being asymptomatic for so long right now , i'm comfortable with that option . but what do you think ?

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Betty Hill is a 53 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of suspected esophagitis. The patient was referred from the emergency department where she was seen in early 10/2020 following 4 days of chest pain. The pain has resolved but she kept this appointment to discuss the original 4-day episode. The patient describes her chest pain in early 10/2020 as sharp and localized behind the sternum. She states that it felt like a heart attack and the onset was sudden. The pain was exacerbated by eating and accompanied by dysphagia. The patient is not able to say whether she had heartburn as she has never experienced heartburn before and is unsure what it feels like. When asked about potential triggers, the patient identifies that she was experiencing a lot of stress at that time due to a job transition. She was able to tolerate the chest pain and dysphagia for 4 days but reports that nothing she tried relieved her symptoms. She then presented to the emergency department and underwent labs and EKG. All results came back normal from these tests. She was not prescribed any medications in the emergency department but was given a referral to me for suspected esophagitis. Her chest pain and dysphagia resolved spontaneously approximately 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred. The patient denies unintentional weight loss, weight gain, abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. She states she is trying to lose weight. PAST HISTORY Medical Uterine fibroids. Anemia. Surgical Cholecystectomy. FAMILY HISTORY None reported. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS • Cardiovascular: Positive for chest pain. • Gastrointestinal: Positive for difficulty swallowing. • Psychiatric: Positive for stress. PHYSICAL EXAM Gastrointestinal Mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants. RESULTS The patient’s emergency department records from her 10/2020 visit were reviewed, including the normal cardiac workup. ASSESSMENT The patient presents today following a visit to the emergency department in early 10/2020 for 4-days of sharp chest pain, made worse by eating, and dysphagia. Notably, the patient was experiencing higher levels of stress than normal for her at that time due to a job transition. Her cardiac evaluation in the emergency department was normal and she was referred to me for suspected esophagitis. The patient’s pain and associated dysphagia spontaneously resolved 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred. Possible etiologies of her chest pain and dysphagia include GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal etiologies, and anxiety. Based on her history today, I suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition, plus or minus a contribution from musculoskeletal etiologies. Non-cardiac chest pain. Suspected etiology of anxiety with or without underlying musculoskeletal etiology. PLAN • We discussed the role of an EGD in evaluating her prior symptoms. Given her current asymptomatic status, I am comfortable foregoing the EGD for now in lieu of continued monitoring for symptom recurrence. The patient agreed to notify my office if her symptoms return at which time, we could schedule the EGD. The patient is agreeable to this plan. INSTRUCTIONS • Self-monitor for symptom recurrence and notify my office if this occurs. • Follow up as needed.","**Assessment**  
Betty Hill is a 57‑year‑old female with a past history of uterine fibroids and anemia who presents as a new patient for evaluation of a single episode of acute, sharp, retro‑sternal chest pain lasting four days in early October 2020. The pain was described as “like a heart attack,” was aggravated by food intake, accompanied by transient dysphagia, and resolved spontaneously within three days. Emergency‑room work‑up (ECG, cardiac enzymes) was normal; cardiac etiology was therefore considered excluded. Physical examination reveals mild tenderness to light palpation of the upper abdominal quadrants, otherwise unremarkable.  

Possible etiologies for the resolved episode include:  

- **Gastro‑esophageal reflux disease / esophagitis** – pain triggered by eating, transient dysphagia, and upper abdominal tenderness.  
- **Dyspepsia** – epigastric discomfort related to meals.  
- **Musculoskeletal strain** – atypical presentation but cannot be completely excluded.  
- **Anxiety / stress‑related** – recent job transition, stressful circumstances may have contributed to a functional chest pain syndrome.  

Given the lack of ongoing symptoms, normal cardiac work‑up, and normal endoscopic findings likely (if performed later), the most likely cause is a self‑limited reflux/oesophagitis episode possibly amplified by stress.

**Plan**  

1. **Symptom monitoring** – Patient instructed to self‑monitor for recurrence of chest pain, dysphagia, heartburn, or new GI symptoms. She will call the office promptly if symptoms return or worsen.  
2. **Upper endoscopy (EGD)** – Discussed the option; patient elected to defer EGD at this time and prefers a watch‑and‑wait approach. Will be reconsidered if symptoms recur.  
3. **Lifestyle / dietary modifications**  
   - Advise avoidance of large, fatty, spicy meals and lying down soon after eating.  
   - Elevate head of bed 6–8 inches.  
   - Encourage weight loss if applicable and smoking cessation (if applicable).  
   - Stress‑reduction techniques (e.g., mindfulness, counseling) given recent job transition stress.  
4. **Medication** – No immediate pharmacotherapy prescribed; will consider a trial of a short course of a proton‑pump inhibitor (e.g., omeprazole 20 mg daily) if symptoms recur.  
5. **Follow‑up** – Routine primary‑care follow‑up in 3–6 months for reassessment of GI health, or sooner if symptoms return.  
6. **Documentation** – Note that the patient has been informed of the differential diagnoses (GERD/esophagitis, dyspepsia, musculoskeletal, anxiety) and the rationale for deferring endoscopy.  

Patient understands and agrees with the monitoring plan and will contact the clinic with any change in her condition."
"hello .  hi .  i'm dr. evelyn , one of the kidney doctors . it's good to meet you guys .  it's nice to meet you also .  yeah . so i was reading about this syndrome that i actually have never heard of .  yeah , me too .  i do n't think it's very common .  definitely not . it's c- pretty rare .  so-  can you start at the beginning ?

 uh- . yeah . she just had a hard time regulating her temperature , but she did fine . she does have a gi doctor , because she has reflex really bad . she also had a dietician , who told us to take her off cow's milk . which we did . and then she has seen an allergist , and also a neurologist ... who diagnosed her with this syndrome , because she still does n't walk and she was n't sitting by herself a year old .  yeah .  but so now she is crawling and she is trying to take steps , so think she's doing pretty good .  good . is she in therapy ?  she is in therapy . she's in feeding therapy , occupational therapy , and also physical therapy .  awesome . okay .  and we also have speech therapy , who is going to be starting within the next couple of weeks .  that's great .  so , she has a lot of therapies . we have also seen an orthopedic and an ophthalmologist . i can never say that . we have seen everything , really .  and audiology too , right ?  yes .  yeah , wow. .  yeah , it has definitely been a whirlwind of stuff . when we saw the geneticist , she told us that sometimes people with this syndrome , they have trouble with their kidneys . that they might actually fuse into one . she also said sometimes they have problems with their legs , so that was why we saw ortho .  okay . okay .  so we have seen everybody , really . we are just here to make sure that her kidneys are looking good right now .  yeah , okay . so , um , tell me about how many wet diapers she has in a 24 hour period ?

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Katherine Lopez is a 22-month-old female, born at 34 weeks +3 days gestation, diagnosed with the rare Smith-Magenis syndrome and associated global developmental delays. She was referred to nephrology by genetics who recommended renal screening tests. At birth, the patient weighed 4 pounds 8 ounces, exhibited difficulties during eating where she would stop breathing, and challenges regulating her body temperature; determined to be typical issues associated with premature birth. The patient has seen many specialists, including GI for severe reflux, a dietitian who recommended discontinuing consumption of cow’s milk, and a neurologist who diagnosed her with Smith-Magenis syndrome. Additionally, she has been seen by a geneticist, orthopedist, ophthalmologist, and audiologist. The patient is not ambulatory, did not sit up unassisted until 1 years old, and is currently crawling and attempting to take steps. She will be starting speech therapy in the next few weeks, and currently she is in occupational, feeding, and physical therapy. The geneticist informed the patient's mother that patients with Smith-Magenis syndrome usually have kidney issues where “the kidneys fuse into one” and issues with their legs. The patient has approximately 8 to 10 wet diapers in a 24-hour period. Her mother notes that she is doing better with drinking fluids and she urinates “a lot”. The patient drinks Ripple Pea Protein milk instead of cow’s milk, water and water mixed with a small amount of juice. Her twin sister is approximately the same size, and their weight is essentially the same, she is healthy, and the mom denies any known health concerns or diagnoses. The mom states that Katherine is shorter and seems chubbier related to her syndrome. She also has a 9-year-old brother who is diagnosed with autism. BIRTH HISTORY Twin gestation. Birth weight 4 pounds 8 ounces. PAST HISTORY Medical Smith-Magenis syndrome. SOCIAL HISTORY Patient accompanied to appointment by her mother. Sibling: 9-year-old brother and twin sister. FAMILY HISTORY Brother: 9 years old, positive for autism. Twin sister: absence of Smith-Magenis syndrome, no known health conditions. No known family history of genetic conditions, kidney failure, dialysis, or kidney transplant. PHYSICAL EXAM Constitutional Well-nourished female, slightly fussy when examined. Eyes Presences of microphthalmia. Genitourinary Normal external female genitalia. Musculoskeletal Extremities: Presence of mild hypotonia of lower extremities and the arms. ASSESSMENT • Smith-Magenis syndrome. Katherine is a 22-month-old former 34+3-week-old twin with Smith-Magenis syndrome. Several organ systems can be affected by this chromosomal deletion syndrome and congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract have been reported in the literature. PLAN We will obtain a kidney ultrasound screening today. If there are abnormalities on the kidney ultrasound, we will determine the next steps and future follow-up. The family lives in Dallas, Georgia, so her follow-up should be at the Town Center location. INSTRUCTIONS Complete ultrasound today. I will call patient with results and possible next steps.","**Assessment**

hey diana it's good to see you in here so i see that you injured your wrist could you tell me a bit about what happened  yeah i was walking up and down the stairs i was doing my laundry and i slipped and i tried to catch myself and i put my arms out to catch myself and then all of a sudden i just my wrist started to hurt real bad and it got real swollen  wow okay so which wrist are we talking about left or right  it's my right one of course  okay and then have you ever injured this arm before  no i have not  okay alright so on a scale of one to ten how severe is the pain  gosh it's like a nine  wow okay have you done anything to ease it  yeah i did the ice thing i put ice on it and then i you know i even i have a ace wrap at home i try to do that  mm-hmm  and then i took some ibuprofen but it helps a little bit but it's just it's it's just not right  okay  really  yeah okay have you sorry i'm trying to think how long ago did this injury happen  this happened yesterday morning  okay  maybe just you know i just bumped it but  okay  it's just not it's really bad  okay no i understand okay so i'm going so you said you were doing laundry  yes i had my back hit my basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out a little bit i was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally  okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere  no not really  okay  it's just really along my wrist  okay any numbness any tingling  a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still  mm-hmm  but just maybe a little bit of tingling  okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright  okay  okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt  yes  okay  it does  and what about the outside does that hurt as well  yeah it does  are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like  not without extreme pain  okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up  yeah i have a hard time doing that actually  alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt  yeah  alright and then lateral as well  yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason  alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist  hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight  okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you  yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all  okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down  it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better  okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to  i'm sorry  pardon what  a what  we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace  okay thank you  sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay  when do i have to have the surgery  we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform  okay  alright so what  how how long do i have to wear that brace  you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks  six weeks  yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of  oof  these these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version alright no problem any other questions  no well i am going on vacation do i need to cancel it like can i still go even with the i mean after the surgery  yeah  do it as soon as possible i'm going a vacation in a month so  okay how long is the vacation  it's only for like a couple weeks  okay well so you might have to postpone it just because depending on what physical therapy says right if they feel that you can sustain if you can like sustain the exercises while you're gone that if there's something that you can do by yourself then you should be fine but we do wan na give it you said that it's gon na happen in a couple of weeks  no vacation in a month  okay okay yeah so how about in a month we come you come back let's do a checkup again see where we are at and then we can assess whether or not this is something that i would recommend you do  that sounds good thank you  no problem bye  bye  the fracture appears extra-articular and usually proximal to the radial ulnar joint dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree if dorsal angulation is severe presenting with a dinner fork deformity ulnar styloid fracture is present,"CHIEF COMPLAINT Right wrist injury. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Diana Scott is a pleasant 61-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right wrist injury. The patient sustained this injury yesterday morning, 05/12/2022, when she slipped on the stairs while carrying a laundry basket. She states she tried to catch herself with her arms outstretched. The patient reports an immediate onset of pain and swelling in her right wrist. She denies any previous injuries to her right arm. The patient rates her pain level as a 9/10. Her pain is aggravated by movement. The patient also reports numbness and tingling in her fingers. She has been icing and wrapping her right wrist with an ACE wrap. The patient has also been taking ibuprofen, which provides some relief. She notes fully extending her arm while resting it on a pillow alleviates some of her pain as well. The patient is going on vacation in 1 month. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS Musculoskeletal: Reports right wrist pain and swelling. Neurological: Reports numbness and tingling to the digits of the right hand. VITALS Blood Pressure: Elevated at 140/70 mmHg. Heart Rate: 80 beats per minute. Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute. Body Temperature: 97.2 degrees F. HEAD: Normocephalic NECK: No swelling noted CV: No bilateral lower extremity edema. No carotid bruit. No murmurs, gallops or rubs heard during auscultation of the heart. Palpabale pulses to the bilateral lower extremities. RESPIRATORY: Normal respiratory effort no respiratory distress. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. GI/GU: Non-distended BACK: No evidence of trauma or deformity NECK: No adenopathy. No thyromegaly. MSK: Examination of the right wrist: Limited range of movement. Tenderness to palpation. Pain on flexion and extension. Pain with radial deviation and lateral deviation. Pain with wrist abduction and adduction. The metacarpals are intact. Obvious swelling and bruising. Tenderness on palpation throughout. There is evidence of potential fracture feeling and bony crepitus. RESULTS X-rays of the right wrist were taken today. These reveal the fracture appears extra-articular and proximal to the radioulnar joint. Dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree. Dorsal angulation is severe, presenting with a dinner fork deformity. An ulnar styloid fracture is present. ASSESSMENT Right wrist Colles fracture. PLAN After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays revealed a right wrist Colles fracture. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we proceed with a right wrist ORIF and all indicated procedures. We reviewed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. I explained that we should schedule the operation for as soon as possible to ensure adequate healing and to limit malformation of the wrist. I advised that this procedure will require her to be admitted to the hospital for an overnight stay. In the meantime, the patient will be placed in a thumb spica brace and receive instructions on its proper usage. I have prescribed the patient Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours to treat her pain. We also discussed that her postoperative course will include wearing a brace for 6 weeks. A few weeks after surgery, the patient will initiate formal physical therapy and will attend 3 times per week to strengthen her right wrist. The patient has a 2-week vacation planned in 1 month. I recommended that we consult with her physical therapist to determine if there are exercises she can perform on her own instead of postponing her vacation. INSTRUCTIONS The patient will follow up with me in 4 weeks status post surgery to discuss her progress.","**CHIEF COMPLAINT**  
Right wrist pain and swelling after a fall (slipped while doing laundry).

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**  
The patient sustained a right‑wrist injury yesterday when she slipped on the stairs, tried to catch herself, and felt an abrupt “pop.” Immediate severe pain (rated 9/10) and rapid swelling developed. She applied ice, used an over‑the‑counter ACE wrap, and took ibuprofen with only minimal relief. She denies prior wrist injuries. She reports mild tingling in the fingers, but can still move the hand minimally. She rates current pain at 9/10 at rest and notes that maintaining the wrist in a neutral, slightly elevated position (e.g., on a pillow while typing) is most comfortable.

**REVIEW OF SYSTEMS**  
- **Constitutional:** No fever, chills, or weight loss.  
- **Neurologic:** Mild tingling in the fingers of the injured hand; no motor weakness.  
- **Musculoskeletal:** Severe pain with all wrist motions (flexion, extension, radial and ulnar deviation); limited fist formation; obvious swelling and ecchymosis.  

**PHYSICAL EXAM**  
- **Vitals:** BP 140/70 mm Hg, HR 80 bpm, RR 20 /min, Temp 97.6 °F – hemodynamically stable.  
- **General:** Alert, in mild distress from pain.  
- **Extremities – Right Wrist:** Marked swelling, bruising, tenderness to palpation over the distal radius/ulna, crepitus on gentle pressure, 1+ pitting edema. Pain reproduced with flexion, extension, radial and ulnar deviation; active range of motion severely limited. No gross deformity of the forearm. Neurovascular status intact (radial pulse present, capillary refill < 2 s, sensation to light touch preserved).  

**IMAGING RESULTS**  
- **Plain radiograph (right wrist):** Extra‑articular distal radius fracture consistent with a classic *Colles* fracture – dorsal angulation of the distal fragment with a “dinner‑fork” deformity. Mild dorsal displacement; ulnar styloid fragment noted.

**ASSESSMENT**  
1. **Acute right distal radius (Colles) fracture – extra‑articular, dorsal angulation.**  
2. **Mild sensory tingling likely secondary to soft‑tissue swelling.**  
3. **Pain control needed (moderate‑severe).**  

**PLAN**  

| Issue | Management |
|-------|-------------|
| **Fracture fixation** | • Schedule operative open‑reduction internal fixation (ORIF) with volar locking plate and screws as soon as possible (ideally within 1 – 2 days). <br>• Admit for overnight observation post‑op; discharge home the following day if stable. |
| **Immobilization** | • Apply a removable wrist brace (thumb‑spica style) immediately after reduction. <br>• Continue brace for **≈ 6 weeks** post‑op, then transition to a removable splint per surgeon’s protocol. |
| **Analgesia** | • Prescribe **Tramadol (Ultram) 50 mg PO q6 h PRN** for breakthrough pain. <br>• Continue ibuprofen 600 mg PO q8 h with food for anti‑inflammatory effect, unless contraindicated. |
| **Rehabilitation** | • Initiate hand‑wrist physical therapy **≈ 3 times/week** beginning 2‑3 weeks post‑op (after initial immobilization period). Focus on range of motion, grip strength, and gradual return to functional activities. |
| **Follow‑up** | • Post‑op day‑1 tele‑visit for wound check and pain assessment. <br>• In‑person visit at **2 weeks** to assess healing, brace fit, and neurovascular status. <br>• Subsequent visits at **6 weeks** (brace removal) and **12 weeks** (full functional assessment). |
| **Activity precautions** | • Keep wrist elevated when possible; avoid lifting > 5 lb for 6 weeks. <br>• Delay planned vacation until after the 6‑week immobilization period and clearance from PT/orthopedic surgeon. |
| **Patient education** | • Discuss signs of complications (increasing pain, swelling, erythema, numbness, fever). <br>• Emphasize medication timing (all oral meds can be taken together with food). <br>• Provide written after‑care instructions and contact information for urgent concerns. |

The patient verbalized understanding, agreed to the surgical plan, and will coordinate with the scheduling team today. No further questions at this time."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Wayne Taylor is a pleasant 66-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain. The onset of his pain began 3 weeks ago. He denies any specific injury. The patient states he is active and has been renovating his basement. He reports a history of intermittent aches and pains in his left shoulder. He has difficulty reaching for or lifting any objects. He adds that he avoids reaching overhead secondary to the pain. The patient describes his pain as constant and worsening. He notes his pain is unbearable when lying on his left shoulder at night. He denies any numbness or tingling in the bilateral upper extremities. He has been taking 2 Extra Strength Tylenol every 6 to 8 hours, which provides some relief. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS Musculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain. Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling in the bilateral upper extremities. VITALS All vital signs are within the normal limits. PHYSICAL EXAM Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. NEURO: Normal sensation. Sensation is intact to light touch in the left upper extremity. MSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints. Good hand grip. RESULTS X-rays of the left shoulder were obtained and are reviewed today. These reveal there are no fractures. ASSESSMENT Left shoulder pain, most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. PLAN After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. I recommend obtaining an MRI of the left shoulder to further assess the rotator cuff. I will also refer him to formal physical therapy to strengthen his left shoulder for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. The patient was provided with educational materials regarding expectations related to his physical therapy. He may continue to take Tylenol as needed. If his symptoms do not improve with physical therapy, we will consider a steroid injection to the left shoulder. All questions were answered. INSTRUCTIONS The patient will follow up with me after he has completed his course of physical therapy.","**Assessment & Plan – Left Shoulder Pain**

- No prior shoulder injections or PT.

**Physical Exam**
- Limited active & passive ROM of the left shoulder; pain on movement.
- Tenderness over the greater tuberosity; no tenderness at the SC or AC joints.
- Hand grip strong; distal neurovascular exam normal (capillary refill <3 s, light‑touch sensation intact).
- Plain radiographs: no fracture or bony abnormality.

**Impression**
- Likely **rotator‑cuff tendinopathy** (suspected supraspinatus/partial‑thickness tear) given activity‑related strain, tenderness over the greater tuberosity, and normal X‑ray.

**Plan**
1. **Imaging**
   - Order left shoulder MRI (preferably within 1 week) to confirm rotator‑cuff pathology and rule out full‑thickness tear.

2. **Physical Therapy**
   - Refer to outpatient PT for a 6‑8‑week program focusing on rotator‑cuff strengthening, scapular stabilization, and gentle range‑of‑motion exercises.
   - Provide PT education handout on home stretching/strengthening.

3. **Medication**
   - Continue acetaminophen q6‑8 h as needed (max 4 g/day).
   - If pain persists >48 h after PT initiation, consider a **single corticosteroid injection** into the subacromial space.

4. **Activity & Self‑Care**
   - Avoid heavy overhead lifting and aggravating activities until symptoms improve.
   - Ice shoulder 15–20 min, 3–4 times daily for symptomatic relief.
   - Use a pillow to keep the affected side up while sleeping.

5. **Follow‑up**
   - Return visit in **2 weeks** (or sooner if MRI results are available) to review imaging, assess PT response, and determine need for injection or further referral.

6. **Patient Education**
   - Discuss rotator‑cuff anatomy, typical healing timeline (4–6 weeks with PT), and signs that would warrant earlier re‑evaluation (increasing weakness, numbness, or night‑time pain unrelieved by medication).

okay hi andrea well i  hello  i understand you're you've come in with some right knee pain can you tell me about it what's going on  it it's not the right knee it's the left knee  okay the left knee

the blood pressure medicine morning and night  okay alright so are you are you eating like late at night or anything like that  no we usually eat by six  okay okay alright well hopefully we can get you to feeling better okay so i want to do a quick physical exam really check that knee out so your vital signs look good they they look alright your temperature is ninety eight . two your pulse is seventy two respirations are sixteen blood pressure is one twenty two over seventy so that looks fine i'm gon na go ahead and take a listen to your heart and lungs so on your heart exam it's a nice regular rate and rhythm but i appreciate a slight two over six systolic ejection murmur at the left base here on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally okay now let's take a

result of your left knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so lem me tell you a little bit about my plan so your left knee pain i think you just have some arthritis in that i want to prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams a day we might do some physical therapy for that just to strengthen the muscles around that area and prevent any further problems with that okay and so for your second problem the hypertension so i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams a day and order an echocardiogram just to evaluate that heart murmur alright and  okay  for the diabetes mellitus i wan na order a hemoglobin a1c to see if we need to make any adjustments to your metformin and i'm also gon na order a lipid panel okay do you have any questions  no i do n't think so when will all this take place  we will get you scheduled for the echocardiogram i will have my nurse come in and we will get that set up okay,"CHIEF COMPLAINT Left knee pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Andrea Barnes is a 34-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of left knee pain. The patient has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain and sudden instability with ambulation. Her pain is localized deep in her patella and occurs less than once daily. Due to the fleeting nature of these episodes, she has not taken medication and simply braces herself until it passes. She denies any trauma or injury, or ever hearing or feeling a pop in the knee. Her symptoms do not interfere with her daily activities and she does not use a cane. Regarding her hypertension, it has been several days since she last checked her blood pressure at home, but it was approximately 120/70 mmHg at that time. Her current medications include amlodipine, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide, all of which she takes on a regular basis. In terms of her diabetes, her fasting morning blood glucose levels have been approximately 130 based on home monitoring. This is slightly higher than usual, even though she has been compliant with metformin and Farxiga. She does try to avoid eating late at night. MEDICAL HISTORY Patient reports a personal history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. SOCIAL HISTORY Patient likes to travel and is planning a trip to Columbus, Georgia in the next month or so. She is part of the Lion's Club. MEDICATIONS Patient reports that she is taking amlodipine, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide, Metformin, and Farxiga. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS Musculoskeletal: Reports left knee pain and instability, VITALS Temperature: 98.2 degrees F Heart rate: 72 bpm Respirations: 16 Blood pressure: 122/70 mmHg PHYSICAL EXAM MSK: Examination of the right knee: No ecchymosis or edema. No effusion. No pain with palpation. Examination of the left knee: Full range of motion. Negative varus and valgus stress test. RESULTS X-rays were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality. ASSESSMENT 1. Left knee pain. 2. Hypertension. 3. Diabetes mellitus type 2. PLAN After reviewing the patients x-rays, I believe there is some arthritis in the knee. I'm going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily. We can consider physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the area to prevent any further issues. Her hypertension is well controlled with her current medication regimen. She can continue with lisinopril 20 mg once daily. I'm also going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation of the murmur heard on exam. She has been compliant with metformin as prescribed, but her blood glucose levels have been slightly elevated recently. I'm going to order a lipid panel, as well as a hemoglobin A1c to determine if any adjustments need to be made to her dose of metformin.","**ASSESSMENT & PLAN**

**1. Left knee intermittent instability/pain (likely early arthritic changes)**
- **Findings:** Intermittent “giving‑out” while walking, no trauma, no swelling, full ROM, normal X‑ray, no effusion or tenderness on exam.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Start Meloxicam 15 mg PO daily for anti‑inflammatory effect.  
  - Recommend a trial of physical therapy 2‑3 × week to strengthen quadriceps/hip abductors and improve joint stability.  
  - Counsel on use of a cane or knee brace during prolonged walking/activities (e.g., upcoming line‑dance event).  
  - Re‑evaluate in 4‑6 weeks; if symptoms persist, consider further imaging (MRI) or referral to orthopedics.

**2. Hypertension – suboptimally controlled**
- **Current regimen:** Farxiga, Amlodipine, Lisinopril, Hydrochlorothiazide (dose unspecified). Home BP ~120/70 but occasional elevations noted.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Increase Lisinopril to 20 mg daily.  
  - Continue other antihypertensives as is.  
  - Advise home BP monitoring twice daily (morning/evening) for 1 week and log results.  
  - Order transthoracic echocardiogram to evaluate a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur and assess cardiac function.  
  - Follow‑up in 2 weeks to review BP log and echo results.

**3. Type 2 Diabetes – mild hyperglycemia**
- **Current regimen:** Metformin (dose unspecified) + Farxiga. Fasting glucose ~130 mg/dL.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Order Hemoglobin A1c to assess overall glycemic control.  
  - Review metformin dose at next visit; consider titration if A1c >7 % or fasting glucose remains >130 mg/dL.  
  - Reinforce dietary timing (no late‑night meals) and regular exercise as tolerated.

**4. Dyslipidemia**
- **Plan:** Order fasting lipid panel (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides) to guide statin therapy if indicated.

**5. Preventive care**
- **Plan:** Schedule routine mammogram (due per age guidelines).  

**Patient Education & Follow‑up**
- Discuss medication adherence (set phone alarms for AM/PM dosing).  
- Emphasize importance of home BP and glucose logs.  
- Encourage gentle low‑impact activity (e.g., walking, stationary bike) while PT progresses.  
- Return visit in 2 weeks for BP review; earlier if knee pain worsens or new symptoms develop."
so beverly is a 53 -year-old female with a recent diagnosis of stage three nonsmile cell lung cancer who presents for follow-up during neo agit chemotherapy she was diagnosed with a four . four centimeter left upper lobe nodule biopsy was positive for adenocarcinoma molecular testing is pending at this time alright hello beverly how are you  i'm good today  you're good today yeah you've been going through a lot lately i know you just had your treatment how how are your symptoms  my symptoms are pretty good today i just kind of have a minimal cough and a sore throat  okay  but that's all

cough before how is it as far as walking are you having any shortness of breath  i have n't noticed any shortness of breath it just kind of seems to be a lingering kind of light dry cough  cough okay is it any mucus with it or is it a dry cough  more dry  a dry cough okay and tell me more about this sore throat  this kind of seems to be persistent comes and goes it will be worse sometimes and then others it feels better trying to drink lots of fluids  okay  to see if it can it you know the dry coughing if it's part of that or what i can do  okay and when you mention drinking and eating is do you feel like anything is getting stuck there  no i do n't feel like anything is getting stuck right now and i have n't been i have been eating but not as much as i normally would  okay okay alright and how are you doing as far as like just emotionally and mentally how are you doing i'm just talking a little bit about your support systems  the nursing staff and the office has been very good to help you know with anything that i need as far as support so just since we are just getting started so far on the journey i do feel like i have support and mentally you know still feel strong  okay and how about with family or friends have you been able to turn to anyone  i do have good family members that have been supportive and they have come to my treatment with me  okay excellent excellent and so right now you're on a combination of two different chemotherapies the cisplestan as well as the eupside and you had your last treatment just a few days ago but you're saying right now you've been able to tolerate the nausea and the fatigue  yes i have n't had any nausea but you know just slight fatigue it does n't seem to be overwhelming  okay okay so we are gon na go ahead if it's okay with you and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals so vitals look good especially your oxygen especially with the chemotherapy you've been getting and the cough so your oxygen looks good so i'm happy with that so now i'm just examining your neck especially with your sore throat and i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy and also no supraclavicular adenopathy listening to your heart you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs that i appreciate now on your lung exam when you're taking some deep breaths i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally and what that means is there is there is some faint sounds that i'm hearing which could represent some fluid there so on looking at your skin exam on your chest you do have some erythema on the anterior side of the chest on the left side and this could be related to the radiation so on your lower extremities i appreciate no edema and everything else looks good and thank you i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray it does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation so what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan so for the first diagnosis the first problem of the lung cancer so what we're gon na do is we're gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplacin and the etoside and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five grade and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far  that sounds great thank you  okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss  great  okay any questions for me  i do n't believe so at this time  okay alright so i'll see you at your next visit  great thank you  you're welcome and so now just,"CHIEF COMPLAINT Follow up of stage III non-small cell lung cancer. MEDICAL HISTORY Patient reports history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer.
