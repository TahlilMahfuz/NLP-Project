A limited ultrasound examination of the left upper extremity was then performed revealing a thrombosed basilic vein with a patent and compressible brachial vein. The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. The skin and subcutaneous tissues were anesthetized with 5 cc of 1% lidocaine. Using ultrasound guidance, the left brachial vein was accessed with a 21-gauge micropuncture needle. Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained, before and after establishing an access. A standard 0.018 guide wire was advanced through the access needle into the left subclavian vein but was unable to be passed centrally. At this time, the skin entry site was incised with a #11 blade scalpel. The access needle was exchanged for a 5-French micropuncture sheath with inner dilator. A 0.018 Glidewire was passed through the micropuncture sheath, beyond the area of obstruction, into the right heart. After the inner dilator was removed, an attempt was made to advance the dual-lumen PICC line over the Glidewire into the superior vena cava. However, resistance was encountered at the left subclavian vein, presumably due to near-complete obstruction. The catheter was then removed, trimmed to a length of 20 cm, and advanced over the Glidewire through the peel-away sheath into the left axillary vein for midline placement using flouroscopic guidance.

"The procedure was performed by Drs.  and , the attending radiologist who was present and supervising throughout the procedure. After the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient, written informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. The area around the existing J tube was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. The end of the patient's percutaneous jejunostomy tube was then cut and a 0.035 guide wire was advanced into the jejunum. The old J tube was then removed and exchanged for a 12 French introducer sheath. Inspection of the old tube revealed multiple blocked side holes with the exception of the most proximal side holes. Opacification of the jejunum was then performed with injection of Optiray contrast material through the introducer sheath. This revealed mildly dilated loops of small bowel diffusely but with peristalsis and normal antegrade flow.

Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 120 ______________________________________________________________________________ FINAL REPORT (Cont) CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD AND NECK: Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the aortic arch as well as the origins of the arch vessels. The origins of the arch vessels are patent. Significant atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the common carotid artery bifurcations, extending into the proximal internal carotid artery on both sides. The cervical internal carotid arteries are very tortuous in their course, with the right cervical internal carotid artery, being more superficial just underneath the sternocleidomastoid muscle. There is a short segment of stenosis in the proximal left cervical internal carotid artery, over a length of 1.9 cm, with the narrowest luminal diameter of 2.6 mm corresponding to 45-50% stenosis. No flow limitation is noted distally. In the right proximal cervical internal carotid artery significant atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the bifurcation, causing mild stenosis. These are also noted extending into the proximal cervical internal carotid artery, at its origin causing stenosis with a residual lumen, of 2.1 mm (series 4, image 150), resulting in 56% (55-60%) stenosis. These have not significantly changed since the prior two CT angiograms done on  and , with the measurements, given on the study done on , being slightly underestimated due to technical factors. If more detailed assessment of the stenosis is necessary, this region is amenable to carotid Doppler evaluation and can be considered. The intracranial arteries of the anterior circulation are patent without flow- limiting stenosis, occlusion or aneurysm. The left vertebral artery is dominant. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the origins of both vertebral arteries, left more than right, as well as a few scattered areas of calcifications along the V2 segment of the left vertebral artery. The right vertebral artery is small in caliber, more so in the V4 segment up to the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, likely representing effective PICA termination/ variant. However, there is no flow limitation or occlusion. The soft tissue structures of the neck are grossly unremarkable and without significant change. Unchanged 3-mm left apical pulmonary nodule is noted. There are enlarged left paratracheal and other mediastinal nodes, not completely assessed on the present study.

No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute intracranial abnormality. If there is continued concern for acute stroke, MR of the head can be considered. 2.

However, there is significant atherosclerotic disease involving the common carotid artery bifurcation and the proximal cervical internal carotid artery on both sides, right more than left, with approximately 55-60% stenosis in the right proximal cervical internal carotid artery, witha residual lumen of 2.1 mm. Though the appearance of the luminal diameter has not significantly changed compared to the prior study, the measurements on the prior study are slightly different from the present study, due to possible underestimation which is technical. If considered necessary, further evaluation with carotid Doppler ultrasound can be considered, for better assessment of the extent of stenosis and hemodynamic alterations. 3. Unchanged 3-mm left apical pulmonary nodule, enlarged left paratracheal and mediastinal lymph nodes not adequately assessed on the present study. As suggested before this can be better evaluated with CT of the chest. 4. Unchanged 0.5-mm colonic cyst in foramen of . 5.
