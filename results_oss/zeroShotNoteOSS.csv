"**History** Patient presents with complaints of respiratory discomfort, specifically describing the sensation as muscle pain localized in the thoracic region. Reports experiencing a non-productive cough, notably induced by physical exertion, which becomes particularly noticeable during moderate-intensity exercise such as climbing stairs. Patient has a history of smoking, approximately one pack per day over the last ten years, with attempts at cessation in the past but currently continues to smoke. No reported increase or worsening of symptoms at rest. **Physical Examination** Vitals are stable with no immediate distress. Respiratory rate and rhythm within normal limits; however, slight inspiratory efforts noted upon deep breaths. Palpation of the thoracic musculature reveals mild tenderness of the intercostal muscles bilaterally. No wheezing, crackles, or abnormal breath sounds upon auscultation. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular heart sounds with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. SpO2 at rest is 98%. Upper body range of motion is preserved with no noted limitations or abnormalities.","**History** Pt c/o respiratory discomfort, describes as muscle pain in thoracic area.

"**History** The patient reports experiencing mild respiratory pain over the past three days. The discomfort is described as a sharp, intermittent pain primarily located on the left side, becoming more noticeable with deep breaths or sudden movements. The patient denies any associated nasal symptoms or cough, but mentions having a slight fever, primarily in the evenings, which is easily controlled with over-the-counter antipyretics. There is no shortness of breath or noticeable chest tightness. The onset of symptoms was gradual, with no apparent preceding viral or bacterial infection. The patient’s overall activity level and appetite remain unchanged. **Physical Examination** The patient's temperature is 99.2°F. Respiration rate is normal and breathing appears unlabored at rest. Lung auscultation reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally, without wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi. Palpation of the chest wall elicits tenderness particularly around the left lateral thorax. Cardiovascular examination presents normal with a regular heart rate and rhythm. No lymphadenopathy observed. Oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.","**History** Pt reports mild resp pain x 3 days; sharp and intermittent, mainly on L side, worsens with deep breaths or sudden mvmt.

Activity level and appetite unchanged. **Physical Examination** Temp 99.2°F, RR normal, breathing unlabored at rest. Lungs clear bilat, no wheezes, crackles, rhonchi. Chest wall palpation ttp on L lateral thorax. CV exam WNL, regular rate and rhythm. No lymphadenopathy. O2 sat 98% on RA.","- **Pleuritic left‑sided chest pain (sharp, worsens with deep breath/movement)** – highest priority to rule out infectious or pulmonary cause.  
- **Low‑grade fever (evening spikes, controlled with OTC antipyretics)** – suggests possible underlying inflammation or infection.  
- **Chest‑wall tenderness over left lateral thorax** – consistent with musculoskeletal strain or costochondritis.  
- **Absence of dyspnea, normal oxygen saturation, and clear lung auscultation** – important reassuring finding but warrants monitoring."
