The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. The skin and subcutaneous tissues were anesthetized with 5 cc of 1% lidocaine.

"After the risks and benefits were explained to the patient, written informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table. A preprocedure timeout was obtained to confirm the patient's name, procedure, and the site. The right groin was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. Combining palpatory technique and fluoroscopic guidance, a 19-gauge single-wall arterial puncture needle was used to access the right femoral artery. A 0.035 Bentson guidewire was then placed through the needle under fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was exchanged for a 5-French sheath with inner dilator. After the inner dilator was removed, the sheath was connected with a continueous sidearm flush. A C2 catheter was then placed over the wire. After the wire was removed, the C2 catheter was used to subsequently engage the origin of the superior (SMA) and inferior () mesenteric arteries. Selective superior mesenteric arteriogram, inferior mesenteric arteriogram and superselective arteriogram of several small branches of the SMA were performed. Active bleeding was confirmed at the hepatic flexure, best accessed through a middle colic branch coming off the proximal superior mesenteric artery. Additional selective and superselective angiograms of the SMA and its branches were performed to precise the anatomy and helped determining the origin of the middle colic branch feeding the bleeding area.

After a few unsuccessful attempts with the regular wire, the marginal artery of  could be successfully accessed by using a ""golden"" 0.018 Glidewire. The microcatheter could be advanced over this wire up to just beyond the hepatic flexure, and six microcoils (0.018 x 2 mm x 1 cm) were deployed successively two by two at the level of margin artery while pulling back progressively the mirocatheter. Post-procedure arteriogram was performed which demonstrated no evidence of residual extravasation of contrast and good residual collateral flow at the hepatic flexure, provided by a collateral of the marginal artery arising around the midline and following it parallel towards the right upper quadrant. The microcatheter and C2 catheter were then removed. The sheath was removed. Hemostasis was achieved by direct manual groin pressure for 20 minutes. COMPLICATIONS: The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications. MEDICATION: During the procedure, totals of 1 mg Versed and 125 mg fentanyl were given in divided intravenous doses for conscious sedation under continuous monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic parameters. 10 cc of 1% lidocaine was given subcutaneously for local anesthesia.

There are mild degenerative changes noted in the lower thoracic spine.,No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.,No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality; mild degenerative changes of the lower thoracic spine.
Single upright view of the abdomen shows a feeding tube whose tip terminates within the jejunum and is unchanged from . The unusual course of this tube is secondary to a remote history of abdominal surgery. Non-specific air fliud levels are present. There is a non-obstructive bowel gas pattern with a moderate amount of stool seen in throughout the colon. There is no intraperitoneal free air. The imaged lung bases are unremarkable. There are no suspicious osseous lesions.,"Unchanged NG tube position from approximately five days prior, remaining in the jejunum.","Feeding tube tip in jejunum, unchanged; no obstruction or free intraperitoneal air; nonspecific air‑fluid levels; moderate stool throughout colon; lung bases and osseous structures unremarkable."
"Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained. A right-sided central line terminates in the lower SVC. The lungs are fully expanded and clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.",No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process. No pneumonia.,No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality; right central line tip positioned in the lower SVC.
"ET tube is in adequate position, terminating 4.0 cm from the carina. There is opacity in the medial right lung base, which could represent atelectasis but cannot exclude aspiration or pneumonia in the right clinical setting. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is top normal in size.","ET tube in adequate position, terminating 4.0 cm from the carina). Opacity medial right lung base, which could represent atelectasis but cannot exclude aspiration with right clinical setting.",ET tube correctly positioned (4 cm from carina). Right medial lung‑base opacity – likely atelectasis but cannot exclude aspiration/pneumonia. Lungs otherwise clear; no pleural effusion or pneumothorax; cardiomediastinal silhouette within normal size.
Lung volumes are low which leads to bronchovascular crowding. There is a focal opacity at the periphery of the left upper lobe projecting over the anterior second rib. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.,Focal opacity at the periphery of the left upper lobe projecting over the anterior second rib. This may represent a consolidation although it is difficult to evaluate given low lung volumes. Repeat AP and lateral views with better inspiration is recommended.,Low lung volumes with bronchovascular crowding; peripheral left upper‑lobe opacity; cardiac silhouette normal; no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
